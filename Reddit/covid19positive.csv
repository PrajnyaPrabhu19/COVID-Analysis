I had a family member drop off a pulse ox as soon as I tested positive and have been monitoring my oxygen levels this whole time. Several times today, my oxygen has dropped below 90%, and I wouldn’t have noticed it had I not been monitoring. There wasn’t any real change in how I was feeling and I wouldn’t have known that I needed supplemental oxygen without it. I do not feel sick enough to have thought I’d need to go to the hospital, but had I not come in, I would be risking organ failure among other complications, so I just want to remind you to MONITOR YOUR OXYGEN LEVELS EVEN IF YOU HAVE A MILD CASE.",1610170748.0
Vitamin D.... interesting change in levels 25 ng to 32 ng very quick!!,173,kts30h,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/kts30h/vitamin_d_interesting_change_in_levels_25_ng_to/,89,"Hi, I just wanted to come here and let people know that taking vitamin d on a consistent basis can definitely behoove you and your health. There is so much evidence based on that your level of vitamin d will determine the severity of your covid case. So anyways I randomly got a vit d test bc my reproductive endo did one on me. I thought I would be completely good but actually I was insufficient at the level of 25 ng. So I started doing 2000 iu w magnesium and did a retest 5 weeks later and my results went up 7 points to 32 ng! I think that's so good IMO. Ideally, I want to get up to the 50 range so I will continue the current course and recheck in a couple months.

"A personal COVID timeline with test results, how it affected relatives, and a summary of the frontline doctors comments for a possible explanation of the test results.",9,ktwmi4,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ktwmi4/a_personal_covid_timeline_with_test_results_how/,8,"TL;DR.

1. If you test positive, you probably have it, if you test negative, we don’t really know at all. If you have the symptoms, only a CT scan will show the real picture.
2. You have to get ‘sick enough’ after your symptoms appear to be able to infect others. Tests results more accurate as a result. But then by then you already know anyway.
3. Covid affects the whole body, not just the lungs. Must do coagulation test afterwards and EKGs to monitor the condition of the rest of the body.

Real story.

Symptoms on Day 1.

Tested positive on Day 3 (antigen). CT scan 1 shows covid-specific, but minimal lung damage. Doc’s comments - infection had to have occurred ca Day -7.

Wife tests negative on Day 3 (using the 3 (!) methods: same antigen test negative , pcr test negative, antibody test negative).

‘Wave 2’ hits on Day 10 - they say it’s very common between the critical Days of 10 and 15.

CT scan 2 now shows 40% damage, fever 38.6C/101.5F, coughing, shortness of breath. SpO2 going down from pre-Covid baseline of 95 to as low as 88-90.

Hospitalised on Day 11. PCR at admission negative (!!!), then a positive and then two negatives. Released on Day 18. CT scan 3 shows no further progression from 2, tissue shows early signs of restoration, no permanent fibrosis damage.

Wife starts developing symptoms ca Day 13. Light fever, a bit of cough.

The main conclusion is that a CT scan is by far the only reliable way to see what is really going on.

The ANTIGEN test (administered by a pro, you can’t reliably do it yourself so deep they insert the swab up your nostrils, you will have tears and maybe a bit of begging to stop 😉) is very accurate if positive.

The ANTIBODY test is mostly to see if you’ve had COVID asymptomatically. There are two types - IgM and IgG (pros please bear with me here), one is the ‘immediate’ reaction to the infection, and the other is the long-term immunity longER, rather, it doesn’t last longer than 6 months immunity. Problem being the ‘immediate’ antibodies start (!) developing about 30 days after the infection. So it’s useless as a tool to see if you’re infected and need treatment.

The PCR test. Technically highly accurate with a huge IF. The IF is whether you have enough viral material to begin with and enough of it ends up on the swab. Garbage in, garbage out. As i said before, I tested NEGATIVE while in the hospital on supplemental oxygen. Doc and I had a laugh. This appears to be the quick and dirty government solution - at least we have a shot at getting maybe half of sick people this way, a mass testing method, but not anything to go by in terms of proper diagnosis.

Other than the tests, the huge takeaway was that pneumonia is, however spectacular, only the first manifestation of the damage the virus does to your body.

Anti-inflammatory drugs, Xarelto (the blood thinner) prescribed on Day 1 and still ongoing, administered via IV in the hospital. And that’s just the thrombosis part. Monthly EKGs, blood coagulation tests, diabetes checks (a very common damage), myocarditis, kidney, liver checks, etc, etc. Too many dead in their sleep after a ‘light’ COVID attack and ‘quick recovery’.

So, if you never got sick yet, do get vaccinated.

If you did, do multiple checks for a year now, this disease affects every organ, not just the lungs.

Hope this helps. Again, your doctor will give you the best medical advice, I am just sharing from experience.

Stay safe! Avoid this stuff at all costs!",1610246488.0
Getting guilted into re-testing,6,ktvgkg,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ktvgkg/getting_guilted_into_retesting/,7,"I tested positive on January 1st. I’ve been in quarantine by myself since then. The doctor and department of health said after 10 days I’m allowed to return to work and leave the house as long as my symptoms improved and I am fever free for 24 hrs with no reducing meds. 

My plan was to go back to work on Monday. I’ve worked from home all week except Tuesday because I was very exhausted. My direct team is happy to have me back. HR approved me to come back. 

The problem is that I have a coworker who asked if I was going to get tested again before I go back to the office. My initial reaction was no because the doctor didn’t tell me to. I can tell she’s uncomfortable with me coming back. 

I’m wondering what others have done once they are clear to return to normal life and if anyone did retest. I also heard from my close friend who tested positive the day before me that you can test positive for up to 90 days even if you’re no longer contagious!",1610243057.0

family of 4 with COVID,3,ktxyc2,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ktxyc2/family_of_4_with_covid/,5,"I thought this would be a good time to share my experience with COVID as I approach the end of my 10 days of recovery! If anyone has any similar symptoms or stories please feel free to ask questions or provide helpful tips!

It all started on December 14th, 2020. My dad (59) just had a heart attack and ended up going into the ER to have two stents put in. However, immediately he was tested for COVID and after a couple of hours, the nurse came into the room and told him he was positive. After hearing the news, my mom (48) decided to send my sister (23) and me (f21) to our apartment down the road, while she stayed home with my dad to take care of him. So, from the 14th to the 24th of December my sister and I quarantined and both tested negative on the 16th. Additionally, my mom tested on both the 16th and the 26th of December and it came back negative.

After returning home for Christmas, exactly 3 days later my sister and my mom started to both run a fever, chills, achy body, and headache. On the 29th they tested positive. I once again was sent away on the 29th to our apartment and tested negative on the 31st. However, the next day I developed a sore throat. Finally, I tested positive on January 3rd, 2021, and have since been recovering from the following symptoms: sore throat, congestion, stuffy nose, sinus pressure, ear pressure, headaches (including sensitivity to light and noise), and loss of taste and smell... NO FEVER. Since the 1st I have been taking Vitamin C (1000mg), Vitamin D3 (100mcg), and Zinc (50mg).

This has been quite the experience for my family and myself, so I hope this can help other families who are going through a similar struggle. Below I'll leave all of the symptoms from each family member and the days they tested positive. Stay safe everyone!

We've been monitoring his O2 regularly and it's been in the 90s. We rushed him to the ER and he was admitted. He received his first dose of remdesivir on 1/6 along with antibiotic, steroid, vitamins, etc. He's on high flow oxygen 60L on Airvo and 15L cannula.

I try to check with his care team regularly to get medical details that he wouldn't know. I try to keep his spirit up. I call/text as often as possible without disturbing his rest. I bring him snacks and new clothes to change. I tell him how to do breathing exercises and lay in prone position for better breathing.

It's been two weeks since I started losing taste and smell. It was completely gone for three days and now it's slowly coming in. I can smell more but still not everything and my sense of taste has barely risen above the basics (salt, sweet, sour, spicy, bitter). I can sometimes get a hint of garlic or herbs in my food, but it's mostly just tasteless. I used to love cooking and eating and it's really depressing me. Some days, I feel hopeful that I'm recovering when I can smell a new thing. Other days, like today, I just feel hopeless because of how long it is taking. I just want to be able to taste again. I've read stories of people going months without either and some who still don't have any almost a year later and it's scaring me. What if it never comes back? Can I live like this?

Thought it was a panic attack - ER dismissed me,1,ku014d,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ku014d/thought_it_was_a_panic_attack_er_dismissed_me/,1,"Monday night my body felt very heavy and achy and I had difficulty breathing due to a heavy chest. I suffer from anxiety and it truly felt like a panic attack- the only difference is all of my regular coping mechanisms. We’re not working and by 9am the next morning I was fully hyperventilating because it felt like it would never end. After speaking to some close friends who are nurses and an urgent care facility, they advised I go to the emergency room. My husband took me and I checked in explaining I felt a heaviness in my chest and my limbs felt weird. I said it feels like a panic attack but nothing like one I have ever felt before. They had me change, made me give everything to my husband, and had me sit on a stretcher in the ER hallway for hours without updates. They took my blood to check for vitamins and eventually gave me Ativan. Eventually when I felt calm I found a nurse and asked about being discharged since at this point I was there for 5 hours with no real communication. The then said “oh you don’t want to be committed?”. I was shocked and frustrated and tired I just wanted to feel better and go home. I expressed explicitly that I was not depressed or in danger of hurting myself or others and my husband agreed I truly just wanted the heaviness off my chest. I went home and felt better the next morning but in the evening I knew something was wrong and I felt sick.  I scheduled a rapid test for the am because I had a small cough but really was just being cautious. I’m glad I did because the next morning I awoke feeling like I got hit by a train. My sinuses hurt and o was incredibly congested. I took the rapid and low and behold tested positive. My husband  then started feeling symptoms once I got home and complained of a heavy chest and said he could see why someone with existing anxiety  would have spiraled into a panic attack with the pressure he was feeling in his chest. I’m frustrated the Er never questioned my symptoms or even tested me. I watched others be tested even if they came in for injury not sickness.

I know that it can get a lot worse than losing taste and smell but we really took taste and smell for granted and it's not until you lose something that you really appreciate it and notice how it affects your life.

It has been 24 days since I lost my senses of taste and smell and I'm really freaking out now. I never lost my senses fully, I could smell some things if I got my nose very close and I could taste general flavors like sweet, sour and bitter but no details at all.

My sense of smell saw some improvement overall but it still varies greatly. I can smell more things now but it's still weak, when I walk outside I sometimes smell a general food smell coming from a restaurant then it goes away again, when I smell a jar of coffee the first whiff is strong but if I smell it again it gets weaker !!!! and that goes for most things that I smell. I still can't smell any bad smells like garbage, sweat, farts .... I never thought in my life that I would miss these smells. For some random minutes I get a strong sense of smell back like I apply and smell my perfume like I used to but it gets weak again.

As for taste I see little improvement. I now can ""taste"" toothpaste which I couldn't do before and by taste I mean I taste something but not the taste I know of that toothpaste. The weird thing is I can swear that I taste a few things and they are not related at all, I could taste mint, bananas, popcorn, a specific brand of cocktail juice but not another, coconut milk, a piece of onion in a dish, but I don't know if I really taste them or it's my mind playing games on me because other foods don't have taste at all only sweet/sour/bitter.

Losing my senses really affected me, I became obsessed with researching loss of taste and smell and let me tell you it makes you more anxious about losing them permanently. Food is now a source of sustenance only after it was a source of joy, what's the point of eating a good dish if you can't taste it anyway ?

So does anyone know why we can smell some things but not others ? And did anyone here go through what I am going through now ? I can really use some opinions and help right now.",1610245924.0

Is there a spike in mania or manic behavior in older people recovering from Covid?,6,ktkjf7,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ktkjf7/is_there_a_spike_in_mania_or_manic_behavior_in/,6,"My mom (70F) tested positive for covid Jan 1. She's at least 10 days out from onset of symptoms, but probably more like 2 weeks. Her symptoms were mild compared to others. Fever for 5-6 days. Body aches. Fatigue. Some coughing and runny nose but not much. 

Wednesday was an emotional day for everyone in the United States. My mom and I differ politically, and 4 years ago actually had to make a plan to never talk about politics. We amazingly (mostly) stuck to the agreement. We love each other and she loves and adores my kids..

Wednesday (the night of the insurrection at the capital) night she called me in a manic state. Talking fast. Harsh. Trying to get a lot out. Not really making sense. Long story short she starts demanding that my husband come over the following morning. Won't say why. After several loops of, there's 4 covid positive cases in your house under quarantine, he's not coming over talks, she finally tells me what's going on.

We've been lying to her. Cheating her out of money. Trying to trick her. We're hoarding money and not paying her back. She knows we think she's an idiot, but she's got news for us, she's not an idiot. 

This is a long story but for the sake of condensing, the part of us owing her money for helping with our down payment to our house is true. (Not a hallucination or out of no where). The rest of it.. We're cheating her, lying, hording money, etc that's all untrue. And I don't think, before Wednesday she's ever looked at our situation like this. We check in every other month and are open about where we are with income and bills, etc. She offers every time to loan more, to which I consistently tell her how appreciative we are, but we don't want to borrow money from anyone, but especially not from her since we owe a lot. I'm explaining this to illustrate that her behavior, words, tone towards me out of no where is atypical. She has never ever seemed manic to anyone. 


Is this normal for some covid patients without a history of mental illness? Will it resolve on its own? It's all very upsetting. Every conversation is bad now. Not like the first night, but not good. She is not herself.

I tried my best to maintain distance, but she became so awfully sick that I had to begin to care for her and I was not going to let her suffer without me trying to help. We live under the same roof and we hadn't left the home for 2 months straight during that time period of infection. I am so absolutely traumatized by this experience due to my mother refusing to go to the hospital. I had to sit there and watch her symptoms worsen, struggling to breathe. When she recovered, she had informed me that she was preparing to die on our living room couch. When it was my turn, I only developed the typical mild symptoms. I am sorry for all of this fluff, but it leads to my actual question.

Since my mother and I were previously sick, what are the chances of re-infection? I understand that there is much speculation around this topic, and that antibodies typically last 2-3 months. However, upon further research, I find that there is so much confusion on this topic. I usually come across articles saying ""antibodies last 6-7 months and reinfection is low!"" or ""antibodies last for only 3 months I was sick three times"".

I know everyone's experiences can be completely different. I am a 28 year old male living in the the Northeast United States. I consider myself to be relatively healthy. I have no known medical issues, am not overweight and am somewhat active. Before the world went to shit I was travelling for work all over the country and loving every minute of it.

On Thursday, December 10th, I had helped the woman who lives above me remove a rug from her apartment. I knew that she had tested positive for COVID before Thanksgiving. It had been at least 2 weeks. She had recovered and had been cleared by the health department. We were both wearing masks however her children, who also had contracted  COVID, were in the house while I was helping to remove the rug were not. In total I was in her apartment for less than 5 minutes, probably closer than 6 feet but both wearing masks. The Health Department said that this would NOT count as a COVID exposure since she had recovered from the virus and was presumably no longer contagious. So, if this was not how I got it, then it is possible that someone else brought the virus into my home. I was having some kitchen renovation work done around this time and some of the people were not wearing masks. Anyways, that very next day is when I first noticed mild symptoms, which I assumed was just a cold.

Day One: Friday December 11th: I first noticed some nasal congestion. I typically get a cold this time of year every year, so it did not seem unordinary.

Day Two: Saturday, December 12th: My nasal congestion was worse, I had a bit of a scratchy throat.

Day Three: Sunday, December 13th: On Sunday afternoon I had a sore throat. I gargled with salt water which helped a bit. On Sunday evening, I noticed that I completely lost my taste and smell. Although I was still congested and typically smell/taste is diminished a bit, this felt different. It was a very severe and sudden, complete and total loss of smell and taste. At this point, I felt it was very probably that I had the virus.

Day Four: Monday, December 14th: On/off nasal congestion, still no taste/smell.

Day Five: Tuesday, December 15th: I had a bit of a cough this day and at one point noticed a very severe stabbing sore throat. I noticed some shortness of breath, especially when talking. It felt like I couldn't complete a sentence without having to stop to breathe. Still had a bit of nasal congestion, still no taste/smell. I started taking zinc, vitamin C, Vitamin D3.

Day Six: Wednesday, December 16th: I went to go get tested for Covid today. My taste and smell came back suddenly in the afternoon, but it seemed to appear/disappear a few times before coming back completely. I thought that since my smell/taste came back that maybe I actually did not have Covid. I bought a thermometer off of Amazon and did not have a fever.

Day Seven: Thursday, December 17th: On/off sore throat, bit of a cough. No fever.

Day Eight: Friday, December 18th: Today was the day I got my positive result for Covid, which frankly sent me into a panicking spiral. I was actually feeling better, my sore throat and nasal congestion had disappeared. I still had a bit of shortness of breath, but no fever. Spoke with my doctor who was optimistic I would soon recover since taste and smell came back quickly. I noticed my mouth was extremely dry. I continued to drink lots of water but I couldn't shake that feeling of dehydration. I felt a bit feverish, but did not actually have a fever.

Day Nine: Saturday, December 19th: I was not doing great mentally after receiving the positive result. I did not sleep at all the previous night because I kept waking up suddenly and had very, very strange and vivid dreams, which was unusual. I drank  lots of water as dry mouth was still an issue. Also had a hard time eating anything.

Day Ten: Sunday, December 20th: Slept much better last night after taking melatonin. My temperature was in the normal range all day, but noticed it seemed a little high at 99.0. I noticed some muscle weakness in my left arm. I had been keeping myself busy by going for walks around my neighborhood and noticed that my legs were a bit sore after.

Day Eleven: Monday, December 21st: I felt a bit feverish in the evening. Just overall warm, almost sweaty feeling, hot ears, and dry mouth. My highest temp recorded was 99.3°.

Day Twelve: Tuesday, December 22nd: I felt okay today, but did at one point have a temperature of 100.4°  in the early afternoon. Continued to drink lots of water to stay hydrated. 

After this I continued to feel better throughout the week and never had a fever after. Unfortunately I spent Christmas alone, which was difficult. Overall, the worst symptoms were in the first five days, then after feeling okay for a bit, had a couple days of feeling feverish. I believe the first few days of the symptoms were the initial reaction to the virus, then a few days of my immune system actually fighting it, hence the low grade fevers. I do not know if I had a fever at all in the first few days since i didn't have a thermometer, but I never felt like I did. 

 I am now feeling 100% back to normal. I sometimes worry about the potential long terms effects since this is a novel virus, but I understand that we may not know for many years. The muscle weakness in my arm lingered for a bit but is fine now. Thankfully the 14 people I saw in the few days before I showed symptoms all ended up testing negative.

Being in isolation is difficult, especially when you know you have Covid or are experiencing the symptoms. I had a really difficult time just sitting in my apartment. If you have the energy, I would recommend taking long showers (or baths). You can drag out that whole process to take at least an hour. I took comfort in watching cartoons that I enjoyed watching when I was younger (Hey Arnold!) I also went for short walks around my neighborhood, wearing a mask of course and not talking to anyone. I took zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D3 for immune system and melatonin to help me sleep. Please try your best to avoid going down a rabbit hole of anxiety. This virus is scary and there is so much unknown, but trust that your body will make the correct response to fight Covid and that you WILL overcome this.

Also I’ve been taking zinc and other vitamins since we got our results and been drinking a massive amount of water & Gatorade & pedialyte.",1610214426.0
Talking about my symptoms,1,kto1lk,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/kto1lk/talking_about_my_symptoms/,2,"Alright so I just wanted to talk about my symptoms that I, my brother and my mom experienced. I want to mention that I am a 23M who is 280 pounds. My brother is 20 and my mother is 45. 

The only symptoms we really had were stuffy nose / post nasal drip and diarrhea the beginning and lost of taste/smell later, and constant headaches through most of the virus. 

I lost my sense of smell/taste around 3 days ago but I am already starting to have my smell return but my taste is still iffy where I can barely taste something as long as it sits on my tongue for about 20 secs.

I never really had muscle aches, felt of fatigue or any of the other symptoms except from the list above. My doctor has given me the OK to be out in about in public again. 

I do want to mention that I am extremely lucky and obviously not every case is like this otherwise we wouldn’t of have 350k deaths. Take it seriously, quarantine, and I pray you have it as easy as I did.",1610214269.0
Just trying to stay calm,3,kthk3v,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/kthk3v/just_trying_to_stay_calm/,5,"Hi everyone. Just want to give my ongoing Covid experience.

I am 28 years old, female. No medical issues, relatively healthy. This year because of lockdown, I started running a lot, finished 800km by end of 2020z Believe it or not, I used to be a smoker as well but not heavy. I’ve been smoke free for 3 months. 

I live permanently in Germany but came home to Boston (Im a US citizen) for the holidays since my company forced us on a 3 week holiday. I’ve been in the US since the 20th of December. It wasn’t an easy decision to go home but I had a really stressful year and wanted some R&R with my family and just go off grid. I did exactly that, I became a couch potato.

I think I got the virus from my family nevertheless since they all work in the medical field with active Covid patients and we had a small gathering on Christmas and New Years. 

So here is when it began:

January 2nd: Felt a tickle on my throat and throughout the day I felt body aches. By the evening I definitely was not feeling well and started to have chills, so much so that I couldn’t sleep.

3am January 3rd: Woke up my mother to ask for a thermometer. Registered a 102.7 F (39.3 C) fever. Took some Tylenol. Woke up with no fever and felt fresh. 

January 3rd continued: Decided to observe my symptoms and isolate in my bedroom. I had no fever until the evening, again another high one of 102 F (38.8 C). Can still smell and taste and appetite is good. I had crazy chills and sweats through the day. The Tylenol helped greatly.

January 4: At this point I knew this was not normal. I hadn’t had a fever since I was a child and I was scared. I had a sore throat. But still could smell, taste, and eat. Last few days I had trouble sleeping because of the chills so I started taking Benadryl to help me sleep at night.

January 5: Went to get tested. This is where I felt the worst bite of the American health care system. All testing places were full. It was by luck that my cousin works at a Covid lab and got me a test. My mum who is a nurse also dragged me to the ER to get tested. Because the hospital has its own lab, I got the result within 6 hours. It was NEGATIVE. I was relieved, elated, thanking all the gods in the world. The doctors at the hospital recommended to continue Tylenol for my headache and Aleve. 

January 6: fever finally broke. But I started to have a cough. Continued to test.

January 7: Appetite started to get worse and I became sensitive to savory foods. Can still taste and smell. Cough started to get chesty. I’m also short of breathe each time I walk up the stairs, like a fan a marathon. I always have to stop and lie on my side. 

January 8: the result from the second Covid test came and it’s POSITIVE. All happiness gone. Made all necessary calls. Rescheduled my flight, informed my boss, track and traced people who were around me. I will call my Hausartz on Monday. At this point my cough, which is dry, is worse. On my bed side are all types of medicine, Robitussin, Aleve, Tylenol, bendadryl. 

I’m trying my best to stay calm and not be anxious. Each time I think too much, I get anxious and then I start panicking and that makes me have short of breath and I freak out again. I keep telling myself that a person with breathing difficulties wouldn’t be able to be on the phone for an hour. Anyone else have tips for staying calm?",1610186896.0
Can it bounce back and forth?,7,ktf275,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ktf275/can_it_bounce_back_and_forth/,8,"MY wife and I were both exposed on the 25th of December. I started showing mild symptoms on the 27th which ramped up on the 30th when I confirmed positive. My wife was negative at that time. Today marks the end of my quarantine. I have been able to stay away from my wife. However on the 2nd of this month, she began having mild symptoms and starting to have them ramp up today. We are waiting on her results.

Am I able to be around her? Or would my body take in an extra viral load from her at this point. How would my body react after having just come out of dealing with this?",1610178529.0
"Current experience of a healthy 18M, and a question about COVID brain",14,kt9d5w,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/kt9d5w/current_experience_of_a_healthy_18m_and_a/,5,"First, the question. **To anyone who had COVID brain: how long did yours last?**

I start the next academic period at my school on Monday and I'm taking PDEs, Galois Theory, and some other rather difficult courses that require some thinking. I'm super worried about how I might learn and study if I'm having trouble just holding a conversation.

I am 18M and, outside of my active COVID case, I am in perfect condition health-wise (active trail/marathon runner, diet void of processed foods, 8+ hours of sleep, etc.). Still, my COVID case has really sucked so far.

I began experiencing bad symptoms on January 1st or 2nd. In particular, I had an overwhelming fatigue and I spent most of the day on the ground with no energy to move. Then, from the 4th to the 6th, my body felt like it had gone through a trash compactor and I was bedridden. No fever, only incredibly deep and painful aches and chills. My eyes, shoulders, and lower back were the worst. I couldn't move my eyes or look at screens; my shoulders felt consistently cramped; and I couldn't bend over during those times when I was able to summon the courage to stand up from bed to go to the bathroom or the kitchen. I also had intermittent headaches. Mostly, they felt like my brain was being tickled, but several times I felt a painful compression around my head. I also had an erratic perception of temperature. Sometimes I felt freezing, other times I felt sweltering. Strangely, during these few days, my sense of taste was actually *better* than pre-COVID. At least, the taste of umami was amplified. Alas, this would not last.

Yesterday, my aches and chills disappeared for the most part and I was able to go for a walk (with a mask on and alone on a trail at night). I was nauseated most of the day. I also lost my sense of taste and smell, so I have adopted a diet consisting of soups and smoothies since I can't seem to chew and swallow anything solid. On the plus side, this will give me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experiment with the hottest hot sauces I can find.

COVID brain didn't firmly set in until today. I've felt somewhat tired and ""out of it"" during the whole course of the virus so far, but today is particularly bad. I am terrified by the implications of this. I feel super dissociated and semi-confused. It's not like trying to think through a fog; rather, it's like my head is empty and any sort of thinking is absent. Also, everything I see and hear seems delayed and echoey. I am worried that the effects may be permanent, like if I have permanent microvascular damage in my brain.

If I experience any new symptoms, I will edit this post with an update.",1610161899.0
Covid confusion?,5,ktg2bs,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ktg2bs/covid_confusion/,10,"Hello, I’m hoping to get some help. My father is 72 and has been in the hospital with for the last 2 weeks, his oxygen is everywhere. He cannot walk/ stand. But the most concerning thing is his confusion. He is trying to keep taking his oxygen off because he wants to die. Has anyone else experienced this ? Is there anything that can be done. The nurses are saying that they can take his oxygen and give him morphine, but we are obviously not ready for that. Is there any hope?  We are distraught especially since we cannot see him, and he is refusing to talk to any of us.",1610181775.0
Day 3 - only symptom is fever (no cough/congestion/sore throat?),3,ktit6w,COVID19positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/ktit6w/day_3_only_symptom_is_fever_no/,3,"27 male, no high blood pressure, no chronic diseases. On paper I’m obese.

Question to those who have recovered from mild / moderate illness, have any of you have Covid without cough and congestion?

I keep getting worried it’s going to arrive but I’ve been taking an immune cocktail (wellness formula, vitamin c, vitamin d, elderberry) staying hydrated, and the only symptom I’ve had is a low grade fever. First night I had a fever of 102.4. Since then every day fever has gone down. Day 1 had sore legs but on day 2 muscle aches disappeared.. today fever hasn’t gone above 99.2

Tomorrow is day 4. As of now, I have 0 congestion (can breathe clearly through my nose), no cough, and no sore throat. 

I don’t want to be too optimistic too soon but I’m wondering if I have a mild case. Any others with similar symptoms where you only had a fever or started out with only fever but no cough?

Any insight would be appreciated (I’m a bit of a worrier)",1610191374.0
