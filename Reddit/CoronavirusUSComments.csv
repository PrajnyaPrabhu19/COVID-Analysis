Nothing new to add.. but I really like PlushCare! $99 without insurance or a $10 copay. There are 2 male and 1 female doctors. I see Natalie! She’s really nice with a warm and kind personality. She keeps things quick and simple :),g0h1yc

If you reach out to a local therapist, you may eventually have the option of meeting in person, once it’s safe to do so.

"You get what you pay for. I have a private office and we dont process insurance. Ppl come to me anyway because I can actually spend 45min - 1hr going over complex things. Or have a lazy Sunday appointment over the phone with me if something is bothering you. (www.visitthedoctorsoffice.com)

I'm the main doctor at the Brookfield location. We have a 70yr male doctor who does more cardiac and internal medicine things. $85 for a 2 month supply for most issues (me at least). Pandemic rules allow me to treat people in other states over the phone. Especially anxiety and attention medications are popular right now because 2020 is making people stir crazy. Addiction medicine is a little more expensive because it's a whole different animal.

**Office 414-455-0463**. I have a few people that really like the privacy of no insurance, no computerized files. People with addiction issues, mental health, depression, low testosterone are many of the things working age men come to see me. I have a few die hard patients; one drove down from Canada every month to see me (limit to take Rx over the boarder 1 month supply). Also I'm into muscle/fitness/longevity medicine too.

Thanks for the info,g0h1yc

Pm me. I can do visits over the phone. $85 bucks. Sounds like you need an inhaler and nebulizer too. I can fix it for 6 months. State rules are relaxed during the pandemic.,g0h1yc
Insurance doesn’t cover it,g0h1yc
I could do a physical telemed. The MMA physicals are a lot more intense so I cant do those. Hopefully there are less matches happening. Edit: can't do MMA physicals telemed. Only in person.,g0h1yc

"MN - Minneapolis/Saint Paul - High

99% of people wear masks correctly while indoors in public as the state mandate orders. I was just at a large grocery store tonight with 100+ people shopping and saw a couple people with both mask and face shield on. In the urban areas, there is more adherence to the mask mandate. When you go to the first ring suburbs, I would say mask wearing adherence is about 95-98% of people in public spaces indoors. When you go to outer ring suburbs/semi-rural areas, the mask wearing is about 80-85%, and people are of course not as concerned there (until they try to go to an at capacity rural hospital which is not equipped with Covid ICUs).",kdsqzj

Also I was in my mom's church for Christmas and about 40% of people wore a mask but about 30% of those who did removed it once they were sitting down in church. I don't get that at all.",kdsqzj
"SOUTHEAST

Extremely concerned about people in Brevard County, Florida: The county commissioners RECKLESSLY voted against a mask mandate in Brevard County Florida. Residents here rarely wear masks outside when in crowded gatherings.  They only wear masks in stores, and not everyone wears masks. In offices, they are free to follow the directives of the employers.

Cocoa Florida:

Cocoa Village: People seen gathering outside, with no masks, listening to live musicians /singers, who perform within 10 feet of the small crowd, none (zero )with masks. Name of Pub: the Village Idiot.  (Aptly named pub, eh?)  Observed other outdoor patrons at several restaurant cafes all leisurely enjoying meals, sitting in tables, well within 6 feet of each other. Quick scan of all the people- not one person wearing a mask. A few people wearing masks wear walking around Cocoa Village but it was rare.  During the holidays  events like this were held [https://www.visitspacecoast.com/event/santa-stumble-pub-crawl-cocoa-village-2020](https://www.visitspacecoast.com/event/santa-stumble-pub-crawl-cocoa-village-2020)

Rockledge, Florida:

No MASKS required at all in Rockledge FL  (There is complete freedom to catch COVID19-a deadly disease!) Post office staff member who was clearly not concerned about standing behind a partial and thin plexiglass, was finishing her shift and she had no mask on as she served customers -well within 6 feet of each client. No masks on any of staff of Claytons Crab Company - a store selling seafood which was especially crowded during holidays.

Melbourne, Florida:

In stores, masks are seen most of the time, however, when customers have no masks and it is mentioned to the store employee,  no action is ever taken. None.

Viera FL (part of Melbourne FL) Melbourne FL neighborhoods: People have many cars parked in front of their homes (With out of state license plates and in state license plates) and clearly are hosting parties , with guests who are clearly not living in their own households.

There continue to be many events that recklessly draw people into large gatherings- with no social distancing and no masks.

Viera Community Center: Observed baseball and soccer players aggressively competing  outside (with zero social distancing obviously) and no masks. Several outdoor games being played at once.

USSA United States Specialty Sports Association  [https://www.usssa.com/home/](https://www.usssa.com/home/)Regularly drawing constant influx of thousands of visitors from out of town - they are drawn here to participate in USSSA -  Sports enthusiasts visit Viera Fl as spectators or athletes in competition. They are almost always without masks, sitting in the stadiums cheering or walking around the stadiums, parking areas, or with other athletes engaged in sports and/or posing for team photos.

There is a false sense of security in Brevard County.  People are gathering,  without worrying even a little, about social distancing or wearing masks. Brevard County is actively encouraging gatherings and tourism. Check it out:

However there was recently a super spreader party further North , underage drinking party and it's looking like the parents were......teachers.",kdsqzj
"Lake Tahoe, so CA/NV. Everyone wears masks but distancing is hit or miss. The big issue is we are already a huge tourist destination and have been consistently as busy or busier with tourism as usual. A lot of people are growing tired of the regulations, but we have a new wave of people filling the town every few days. Really makes it feel pointless to put so much effort into even trying.",kdsqzj

Can't speak accurately for the central or northern parts of the state but those tend to be more liberal/democratic in their views.

"Contrary to what others are saying about Florida, I live in North Miami so I’m not sure about other areas, but everywhere I go everyone is wearing masks. Even outside for the most part. I don’t mind people not wearing masks on the beach and walking outside but in stores I never see anyone without a mask.

"I'm in Texas and most people I know are living their lives like normal. It's hard for me because I'm super careful yet family members in other states are constantly questioning why I am still going to my spin classes or why we ate dinner outside on a patio (for the 1st time since March mind you) a month ago. Most of my family is in Illinois where things are a lot more strict. 

I don't do the bar scene and haven't since before this started although my friends still do. I'm in the middle I guess at this point. I wear my mask, social distance and am impeccable with my hygiene. But at this point, for me, it is basically to the point that if I can go out and go to work I can go to my spin classes every week if it keeps me healthy mentally through this. But to get back to the point,  if you wanted to go see live music indoors tonight I could point you in at least 3 pleases within a mile of me open & crowded with not a mask in sight.",kdsqzj
"Life's back to normal, or close to it. 10% of the population seems to be taking the virus seriously, 90% think it's just a hoax and inconvenience. People around me respectfully wear the mask in public, but no one wears masks at parties or gatherings. An equilibrium has formed in that those that are staying at home and/or social distancing have already been identified and excluded from social functions. Unfortunate part is that healthcare workers aren't really taking this seriously either, besides a few nurses and older docs. Another thing is that a lot of healthcare providers/workers/general population try to hide any symptoms of respiratory issues.",kdsqzj
"Spokane WA here 

It really depends where you go. Some people take it seriously and stay away in stores and are diligent with correct mask wearing. I’ve seen this more at Target or Albertsons.

Then you have the people so extreme they will drive to Idaho to grocery shop to get out of wearing a mask/have looser mask rules.",kdsqzj
"Central Oregon checking in. Mostly everyone is wearing masks, even outside, which is excellent. We've been spared the bulk of this until now and I suspect people are tired of everything. 

My employer didn't let us work from home but they are doing the best they can with the resources we have to keep everyone safe. We've had a case in my building but no others that we're aware of. Given the reaction to the first case, though, they might have just decided not to tell us about others.

We do have some anti-mask types here, but they're mostly relegated to the out-towns.

"Philly suburbs; I work in a grocery store and we have maybe one or two customers a day who don't wear masks.

Holidays were business as usual. We're reopening schools later this month while leading the nation in cases per capita. Indoor dining and bars are open. I fucking hate it.

Forgot to add that hospitals are starting to hit max capacity and we're still full steam ahead for schools and sports. Local school here actually did a facebook poll to see public opinion on reopening. It was 1/4 in favor of staying virtual.",kdsqzj
"Milwaukee, WI area here. Mask usage still seems decent, but what people are doing for the holidays concerns me. From what I saw, our state was kind of responsible during Thanksgiving. A good number of people at least said no to the large gatherings. Let’s hope that extends to this part of the holiday season. I’m a little pessimistic though, as I think people are getting too burned out. I know it’s hard, but we can do this!",kdsqzj
"Holland, MI- from what I’ve seen, most everyone complies with mask wearing and it’s usually covering both nose and mouth. I know people who hate the rules and aren’t convinced masks help, but they still wear them properly inside stores. 

I’ve seen about 20% of people in the greater downtown area wearing masks on a near-empty street, outside, by themselves.

In the churches that choose to remain open, attendance is way down. 

Multi-household indoor gatherings is a mixed bag. Most of my friends/family are on a self-imposed quarantine of sorts. Indoor dining isn’t permitted so it’s just people’s houses.

A few people (both Republicans and Democrats) clearly believe it’s overblown and do what they want.

On the whole, about half the people are very concerned. This is just my experience.",kdsqzj

It happened bc my sister hosts at cheesecake factory and got it there. Fuck all of this",kdsqzj

"NC box store worker- It’s a nightmare! I fear for my health daily. Customers remove their mask after they get passed the front doors. Half of the masks wearers will leave their nose out. I have even witnessed a woman pulling her mask off to laugh, another woman taking her mask off so she could pick her nose, and customers are constantly pulling their masks down to ask us questions. Plus, no one social distances! They crowd the employees. I’ve been touched, coughed on, and surrounded by so many customers I thought I was going to have a panic attack because I didn’t have any personal space and no where to go to get away. I was right in the middle and I felt like a bleeding fish who had just attracted every shark in a 25 mile radius during breeding season! I hate going to work. When I’m not at work, I stay home unless I have to make a fast stop to the grocery store and can’t get it delivered. I’ve never been a social person but I absolutely loath people now! I feel like I have zero protection and no safe place at work! It’s only going to get worse also. I wish they would limit the number of customers allowed in to a smaller number and close the store for an hour mid day to really clean the surfaces and let us restock safely. We need stronger and safer guidelines put in place because what we have now is a joke! I don’t know how much more I’m going to be able to take until I snap and run out of the store or go off on someone who is crowding me, getting hostile with me and demanding to know where the toilet paper is! I need my job, I need insurance so I’m desperately trying to fight myself daily to go to work and just go to a safe place in my head while I’m at work but everyday I’m getting more and more upset at the total disrespect and idiocy people are showing! It’s so nice the customers aren’t worried but guess what? I’m scared as hell everyday!",kdsqzj
"I live in NC and had to travel through SC over the weekend. Based on the total lack of mask compliance I saw upstate, you’d almost never know there’s a raging pandemic killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.",kdsqzj

"It’s no better in the rest of the state. Technically, Columbia has a mask mandate...but that only lasts as long as it takes people to get out of the door employee’s line of sight.

Sometimes, not even that long. 

And half of those wearing masks are wearing them wrong- noses out, on their chin, somehow only covering their upper lip- or taking them off every time they become remotely inconvenient

"I would back up what you say:  when I do go out for groceries (maybe 2-3 times a month), La Raza knows what to do & we do it.

EDIT TO ADD: during tax season I make some moolah in a ""franchise"" tax prep office. Last year as tax season was winding down, and the pandemic was just getting started, I went to the office in April to get my last check. Wore a mask and the owner (generally conservative, but usually fair & sometimes funny) gave me crap about it. ""I haven't seen proof that those work"", that kind of thing. I was like ""with respect, boss, **I** think they work and I'm the one I have to worry about."" I also ditched out on the boss's traditional end-of-season party, because nooooooope

I checked back in today, to see about doing tax season again, IF the boss had some measures in place for safety. Didn't speak to the boss but the office manager, who said ""oh we have new procedures this year! Clients will just going to drop off their materials, we'll follow up with phone interviews, we want to keep things safe""

Editing to add- Most businesses around here won’t let people in without a mask, from what I’ve seen. Larger stores have someone at the door for this purpose and counting the number of people entering and exiting. Many sell or provide masks for those who come without. Nearly all have signs posted. Some have messages about mask requirements and social distancing playing between songs.",kdsqzj

My work(office in Indy) requires masks, does temp check, and *recommends* virtual meetings despite 100% of our office being able to wfh. In fact we did wfh for over a month earlier in the pandemic. The mask requirement is very loose and half of the coworkers around me wear them under the nose or around their necks, the temperature check is sort of pointless since everyone is cooled off after walking in from the sub 30 degree outdoor parking lot, and the virtual meetings could literally be done from anywhere since you know, they’re virtual.

"I made the mistake of going to Saraga Intl Supermarket there on the west side back in November and I realized it was a mistake once i noticed that about only 1 in 3 people were wearing masks in the store.

There are about 40,000 car related deaths each year on the U.S. we are at 350k covid deaths in the U.S., currently 3rd leading cause of death, behind cancer and heart disease. We are seeing a case mortality of around 2-3%, with a very high number of cases. 2-3% seems small, until it is a percentage of a large number.

I have known 3 people to die from this so far, most recent was in November. I am glad your father made it through it, but being on a ventilator is not fun, and not many make it off. Wearing a mask when going out is a small price to pay, to prevent spread.",kdsqzj
The worst part is I’m at least 3 times more productive when wfh. Haha. I honestly don’t mind following the mask and distancing requirement like most of my coworkers do. I just want to be more productive and save 2-2.5 hours per day in commute time. Lol,kdsqzj

"I got mine at the baseball stadium yesterday. It was very well organized and no line. But, I was the first batch of appointments and friends have told me there are no open appointments at this time. You need to check first thing in the morning.",kvxnt3
"The vaccine situation in my state is equally botched. Yesterday, the state's emergency app (which has been used since March to report COVID cases daily) notified everyone that those between 18-64 years old with pre-existing conditions could sign up to get vaccinated. Naturally, many people (myself included) rushed to the health department's website to sign up.

Within 5 minutes, the whole site crashed. The HD tweeted out a phone number you could call to make appointments through, but calling the number just gave you an automated message to register online. 

Today I hopped on the website again, and I'm currently in a 10k person queue to register. The vaccine NEEDS to get out to the general population, but so many states lack both the competent leadership and adequate infrastructure to do so effectively.",kvxnt3
But mandatory masks and shutdowns...,kvxnt3
Can I get a fast pass? /s,kvxnt3
What government?  Fed or state or what?    It's the county gov doing it where I live in California.,kvxnt3
Think how we felt in NY in march,kvxnt3
Absent for the past four years. The House of Representatives has been active but that's about it. A lot of the executive agency has been encumbered or dismantled. Very frustrating for the States. Outdated intel may have been compromised. But the nation shall remain standing. All in the name of the general Welfare and domestic Peace. Eight more days for a complete system update.,kvxnt3
"The Republican Party is the party of small government, remember? In other words, it’s your responsibility to take care of distributing vaccines. Pull up your bootstraps, kid!",kvxnt3
I know Newsom requested federal backup but that request has been sitting for a week now. It’s really disappointing.,kvxnt3
...I wanna get vaccinated at Disneyland. Like drive through Main Street to arrive in Adventure Land to have it injected by blow-dart or something,kvxnt3
"Waiting iist for vaccines is like 2 months out at Disneyland, but you can get an appointment tomorrow if you buy one of those Fast Pass thingamabobs.",kvxnt3
Are you a healthcare worker?,kvxnt3
My parents got it last week in CA (work in healthcare) and they were in line for 6hrs at the fire station even though they had an appointment. I sure hope these mega sites are operated more efficiently.,kvxnt3
Right? This should be the norm all over the U.S.,kvxnt3
Amen.,kvxnt3
It would be sick if they gave healthcare workers fastpasses from the fast pass machines like they used to.,kvxnt3
Federal  I can’t comment on the states but it seems the federal side gave up on any restrictions and help.  Like we have the vaccine  in play now let’s get strict and start controlling the spread we slow the spread and get the vaccine out we may beable to have a normal summer and help get the economy flowing,kvxnt3
And michigan too,kvxnt3
Thank the lord!,kvxnt3
"Splash Mountain, except you plunge 50ft into a puddle of vaccine",kvxnt3
That sounds fun. But what to do with the syringe after...,kvxnt3
Haha. And 10 day vaccine passes are better deal than 3 day vaccine passes,kvxnt3
"No.  This is for some middle tier, I think.",kvxnt3
It should totally be. I’m so fucking annoyed it isn’t rn,kvxnt3
"Well Mr Trump has quit doing anything constructive, so the Fed is kind of at a standstill on lots of things.  He is useless.",kvxnt3
We’re going to have to wait for Cheeto Mussolini to vacate the office before the Feds start doing anything serious about COVID. With any luck we can have an actual national response instead of an ineffective patchwork of state and local responses.,kvxnt3
"What country are you talking about? Coz if you’re talking about the US, ummm....... the federal government is run by a dude who doesnt believe in masking.",kvxnt3
The federal government could organize deployments of the national guard to set up vaccination tents and get the vaccine distributed 24/7. They have the resources and people to do that and it would easily pay for itself. There's just no fucking leadership and vaccine doses are just sitting around in storage.,kvxnt3
Cokehead’s wet dream,kvxnt3
Give it to junkies in downtown LA.   Recycling!,kvxnt3
How did you get an appointment?,kvxnt3
"Worse than useless, it’s criminal sabotage",kvxnt3
He quit doing anything?  More like he never even started and now he is going into active sabotage mode.  God I can't wait for that baboon to vamoose.,kvxnt3
And how do they recycle them? Bring them back to disneyland!,kvxnt3
"I think CDC guidelines have been/are being revised to allow vaccination for everyone there’s capacity for, with prioritization first for elderly and hospital workers, then other essential workers, then for non-essential workers under 65. 

Before it was limited solely to elderly and hospital workers, but because of the slow uptake they’re in the process of expanding that. Things vary from state to state at the moment.",kvxnt3
"Are you in Fresno County?  I  can give you the link.
Otherwise start with your county health department.",kvxnt3
One might even call it... obstructive.,kvxnt3
I think what their asking is how did you actually sign up for the appt itself,kvxnt3
"Just curious...if the guidelines now state that it's open for everyone, yet we still have priority groups....how are they ensuring that those in priority groups come first?  We don't have enough for everyone.",kvxnt3
I’m Fresno County. Do you have a link?,kvxnt3
"The decisions are being made state-by-state and are kind of ad-hoc, an episode of the NYT podcast The Daily went into details between two states a few days ago. Basically they're looking at initial uptake of the vaccine from the most prioritized groups (elderly and healthcare workers), and then expanding the availability to more people if they have a huge surplus of vaccine.

The actual details of how that's happening, and the messaging around it from governors and CDC, varies hugely depending on the state though. Everyone was expecting to run out of the initial supply of vaccine very quickly, and when that didn't happen they just had to start changing their plans on the fly. 

So far as I know, CDC guidelines still state that the vaccines should be prioritized only to the most vulnerable groups, and they're in the process of revising that because states are saying that those guidelines aren't working - but CDC may have already changed their guidelines and I just haven't seen that.",kvxnt3
"Sent you one privately.  Chat, I think.",kvxnt3
"Ahhh gotcha.  So it only goes to other groups if there is a surplus.  Makes sense.  I wasn't under the impression that there was a very large surplus in many cases, but I'd be excited to hear that we have more than initially expected.",kvxnt3
