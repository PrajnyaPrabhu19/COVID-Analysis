A short reminder about our rules: Speculation about medical treatments and questions about medical or travel advice will have to be removed and referred to official guidance as we do not and cannot guarantee that all information in this thread is correct.

We ask for top level answers in this thread to be appropriately sourced using primarily peer-reviewed articles and government agency releases, both to be able to verify the postulated information, and to facilitate further reading.

Please only respond to questions that you are comfortable in answering without having to involve guessing or speculation. Answers that strongly misinterpret the quoted articles might be removed and repeated offences might result in muting a user.

If you have any suggestions or feedback, please send us a modmail, we highly appreciate it.

Please keep questions focused on the science. Stay curious!",1610427619.0
