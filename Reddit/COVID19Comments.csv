"In the United States, does it appear that we're going to be reaching our goal of 1 million vaccinations a day soon? I've been following this vaccine tracker:

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations

It appears that we're gradually vaccinating more people on an exponential scale, so we should start seeing whether or not the vaccine(s) can stop the vaccinated from spreading it to others, right? If that's the case, shouldn't we start seeing cases in the United States decline to a sharper degree at some point soon?

My question is how come the participants were not deliberately infected with covid-19? Is it for the host of potential ethical reasons, or otherwise?

I ask because I'm interested in it and the medical process (I have no intention of turning it down), and have also come across numerous people that use portions of the data outside of the realm of what I believe was the intention of the study.

For example, this is the efficacy criteria for Pfizer/BNT:


>Confirmed Covid-19 was defined according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as the presence of at least **one** of the following symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symptomatic period or within 4 days before or after it that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification–based testing, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using a protocol-defined acceptable test).

And here is Moderna:

 >Covid-19 cases were defined as occurring in participants who had at least **two** of the following symptoms: fever (temperature ≥38°C), chills, myalgia, headache, sore throat, or new olfactory or taste disorder, or as occurring in those who had at least one respiratory sign or symptom (including cough, shortness of breath, or clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia) and at least one nasopharyngeal swab, nasal swab, or saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if the participant was hospitalized) that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) test.

Does anyone have any good papers on the immunity offered by historical infection with coronavirus?. lots of stories atm say vaccines prevent serious infection but not necessarily transmissibility of COVID (in that hypotheticatly you could catch and have low levels of infection and transmit the virus). Is the same true of people who have had recent covid. I.e. could they recatch and while mobilising an immune response transmit? I guess this is particularly important in the context of people who have had confirmed coronavirus and therefore behaving as if they were immune.

1) A while ago there was a study that examined surfaces in a covid ward and found that they were unable to recover any viable virus even when RNA was present. Has there been any attempt to replicate that in locations where the surfaces are being cleaned less frequently, like someone's car?

2) Studies on virus half-life have data at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% RH, and at refrigerator temps, but nothing in between, or at lower RH. How would you extrapolate a reasonable amount of time to let things sit in a basement in the northeast US, where it's more like 64 degrees Fahrenheit and below 30% RH?",kvbz9y
"I have a question about how long the virus can live on different things. From what I understand, it can live on fabrics (like masks etc, though I am not sure what fabrics are more or less hospitable for covid) for up to about a week? If I am incorrect, please, someone let me know.

My girlfriend has been a long-sufferer of generalized anxiety disorder. This is exacerbated by a complicated autoimmune/metabolic disease and she is definitely in the “at risk” category so we have to be extra careful.

She grabbed up a bunch of my work clothes today when getting laundry, and texted me asking if that was a dumb idea. I *know* she is scared of having dealt with my out-in-the-world clothes, since I deal with sick people coming and going (generally, not covid specific) all day In and out of my place of work. (I work in b2c pharmaceuticals.)

There hasn’t been a covid scare at my job in over a month, but that doesn’t mean there is 0% chance of me bringing it home on my clothes. We are required to wear masks at work, and socially distance “whenever possible,” which is not super possible in the stockroom where I work.

Aside from her health issues, she is really a wonderful person, actually smart and kind and just super lovable. I hate seeing her suffer mentally and I would like to put her feelings at ease, or at least give her some realistic facts to help ease her fears. She is a rational person and facts can help reduce her fear.

"I have a question about the vaccine in the US (CDC recs) and case fatality rates. I apologize if this has been addressed already or Im misunderstanding something. 

From what Ive seen re CFR there are some medical issues that are higher than being aged 80 and above. For example CFR for age 80+ is approx 14.8%, yet there are medical conditions that have a higher CFR than that. However the CDC is putting high risk medical conditions in the third round (1C). If they want to keep hospitalizations down wouldn't it make sense to put age and high risk medical conditions first? Especially if the variant is more contagious? It seems that those that get really sick or die are either advanced age or have one of these high risk medical conditions regardless of age. Am I missing something?",kvbz9y

"Is there a source for recent hospital-level mortality rates, either published in a journal or continuously updated? The justification for not running an RCT on MATH+ (and maybe I-MASK?) seems to be that:

>...the hospital mortality rate of MATH+ treated patients was approximately a  quarter of the rate of patients receiving a standard of care... \[1\]

which was 5.1% vs 22.9% \[2\]. But in \[2\], they compare hospital mortality rate with \~10 other publications' average rates, and I don't see anything on important statistics about the distributions (standard deviation, inner-quartile range, 95th percentile, etc.) that would be critical to understand if the 2 hospitals using MATH+ are really anomalous. 

Additionally, most of the mortality rates they are comparing against are from April or earlier (latest was early June), while the MATH+ data is from late July. I've seen reports that CFR and/or hospital mortality has been declining as treatment improves and other factors change. So that seems like a misleading comparison.

I can't tell you the exact date for when the vaccines will ""kick in"". The thing to keep in mind is that people who are dying today of COVID19 were infected at least 2 weeks ago, often longer, and the vaccine does not provide an instant benefit to the individuals, so we're talking about time on a scale of ""a few weeks"" and not ""a few days"".",kvbz9y

"They initially said it increases transmission by up to 70% (though I've heard that it might be less that that), which is not the same as increasing R by 0.7.   I assume that the initial estimates come from some sort of modelling exercise, and I'm not sure whether these calculations also take into account that people might well have mixed more during this period.  I'd say it's hard to separate out the different potential causes for the increase and to definitively say that the increase is because of greater transmission.  For sure, the 70% number seems to be (at least in the media) taken as gospel, and where I live government policy is being dictated on the premise that it is true. 

What is less clear is why, since it was first identified in Sept, it's not more widespread in other countries.  Even within the UK you can see that some regions (eg Wales - see figure 15 in  https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/8january2021)) have increasing case rates but low prevalence of the new variant.Where I live they've now identified about 100 cases of this variant.

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-42-sars-cov-2-variant/
Basically, this estimate is based on correlating case increases with estimated prevalence of the variant in specific regions.  What is interesting is that the new variant is more prevalent in the under 20 age group.  To me this makes it a bit harder to separate out effects of greater mixing because this is precisely the age group that is mixing more (until late December they were at school, are more likely to ignore social distancing rules etc).  

Here in The Netherlands the government was advised to expect 170,000 cases per DAY (in a country with population 17M) if the new variant took hold.  Which is some 25 times more than current case levels.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report doesn't give a nice summary like this, but they do report 23 people became pregnant during the trial. They report 2 adverse events related to pregnancy, both in the placebo group.""

"Deliberately infecting people is what’s known as a challenge trial and it does have serious ethical problems that led to that option not being taken. 

During the trial we don’t know how effective the vaccines would be. Deliberately infecting people could cause permanent injury or death in people who would not have otherwise been injured or died, and perhaps in significant numbers if the vaccines failed to be effective.

To properly study this, you would also have to deliberately infect a placebo group as well, in order to establish how much more effective the vaccine is than a placebo. This would be very unethical. 

In addition, we cannot perfectly simulate a natural infection in a laboratory setting. We do not know for sure how the virus is actually spread to be able to simulate that rigorously in a lab. You would run the risk of using too little or too much virus and getting results that do not reflect a real world infection scenario.",kvbz9y

Any story suggesting that the vaccines don't reduce transmissibility are being disingenuous.  There's absolutely no data suggesting that, there's just also no hard data suggesting they do (because that wasn't what the vaccine trials were designed to measure).  In all likelihood, less people developing symptomatic covid will drastically reduce transmission, if not out-right prevent it in most vaccine recipients.

"There's no pressure towards increased infectiousness, increased infectiousness however is always advantageous. B.1.1.7 hasn't had to out-compete its predecessors, it just spread faster and resulted in an increase of cases despite tightening NPIs, giving the appearance of competition.

Think of it this way, if you had two individuals carrying two virus variants with R0 of 2 and 3 respectively, after 5 'generations' you have 32 cases of R0=2 and 243 cases of R0=3 variants. The R0=3 didn't have to prevent the R0=2 variant from spreading to clobber it.

And when you're talking about the wild type being at Rt~1.0 due to NPIs, a variant with Rt=1.4 under the same conditions will very rapidly 'take over' anywhere it exists.

That doesn't mean the NPIs willed the transmissible variant into existence, as in the absence of NPIs the larger number of cases would have given *more chances for the transmissible variant to arise in a shorter time period.* This may explain the seemingly simultaneous appearance of similar variants as *relaxed* post-""first-wave"" NPIs may have been a fertile ground for them.",kvbz9y
"The most effective vaccines prevent 95% of *all* symptomatic disease (as in not even mild disease). In some percentage of these (not confirmed yet exactly), infection was likely prevented entirely; in the others, likelihood of transmission would have been significantly reduced - consistently in studies, the number of secondary cases correlates with overall disease severity.

That's not the same as the vaccine being a free pass to give up on social distancing immediately, as the virus' prevalence in the community is so high that a significantly reduced chance of infection is not fully ""safe"" yet.

They need to communicate this better because there's a lot of ""what's the point of the vaccine then"" talk.",kvbz9y
"The studies conducted by Pfizer, Moderna, ~~AstraZeneca~~, and others only tested for symptoms, hospitalizations and deaths.  They did not test for spread. So we don't know how effective they are at stopping a chain of transmission. 

And it's not an easy thing to know, because of the widespread nature of the virus in many communities in the US, UK, and elsewhere.

If Bob and Maggie, a married couple, were at a worship service, and someone in a nearby seat at the service develops Covid a few days later, a contact tracer would want them them to stay at home more vigilantly, and seek a Covid test. If it's negative, great! Bob and Maggie had only some inconvenience.

But suppose Bob tests positive for Covid after that worship service, and his only close contact points were that worship service, and his wife, who is a physician and has been vaccinated. It wouldn't be possible to know if Bob got Covid from his wife by contact tracing alone. It might be possible to tell with enough test data from the person at the worship service, Bob, and Maggie.

And if you envision a more realistic scenario, where Bob has been around people on a daily basis, the chain of spread becomes even more difficult to measure.

EDIT: I should add that we expect there is some reduction in spread from all of the vaccines. We just don't have the data to say how much right now.

EDIT2: I mistakenly wrote that AstraZeneca only tested for symptoms. That's not quite accurate. They tested individuals weekly with PCR in their trial in Britain (just one of their multi-national trials), and found their vaccine was roughly the same efficacy against asymptomatic Covid as it was symptomatic Covid.

As to antibody tests, that would depend on the test - they are not all the same. Some tests are designed to find the S (spike) protein and would be able to detect vaccine antibodies. Some, like the older Abbott test, only look for N proteins and would not be able to find vaccine antibodies. Check with the test manufacturer.",kvbz9y

"The reasons why your country's numbers aren't going down could be numerous. Without knowing the prevalence of B117 there we can't say.   
The tldr for B117 is that it appears to be a substantially more transmissible variant, likely due to several mutations on the spike protein, although it isn't known exactly how much more transmissible it is or exactly how the mutations affect transmissibility. There's some good hypotheses but nothing definitively proven.",kvbz9y

"The question is based on the big unknown of ""correlates of protection,"" and how we'll determine what need for immunization there is going forward.

Basically the open questions are, do you need an ultra-high neutralizing antibody response do be protected from infection? The answer to that seems to be no, a lower one seems to work; but then the next question is, if you're not protected from infection, is cellular memory protective from disease? And the answer there is *probably yes* but exactly how well in the long run will need to be answered... in the long run. And that will determine how frequently boosters might be needed.

With diseases that vaccines grant immunity-for-life like measles just a handful of circulating antibodies are good enough to prevent infection most of the time and ultra-rare breakthrough infections tend to never develop symptoms or just a mild rash, not the life-threatening illness.

With circulating endemic viruses like HCoVs, RSV, etc., we don't vaccinate against them because they seem to lay down a very different pattern where mild childhood illness is protective from disease, but not infection, for life. And this may be where SARS-CoV-2 is headed.

Also, in number 3, won’t there be another type of immune cell (cytotoxic T?) that could see our muscle cells displaying a foreign antigen and just start attacking our muscle cells, killing it and hence making the vaccine dangerous?

Please help a poor soul out. I really want to understand this. Thanks!",kvbz9y
Thank you! Leaving this up for future reference.,kvbz9y
Thanks for the answer!,kvbz9y

"There are two considerations, one is how long the inmune effect lasts in your body and the other is long before the virus mutates enough not to be recognised by your immune system. Do you know which of those those companies are basing it on?",kvbz9y
"Interesting, thanks. Sounds like an engineering issue, which is way outside my comprehension. Are there studies that look at this? How would a slightly poorly fitting KN95 compare with a tight-fitting multiple layer cloth + filter mask? This is, realistically, the range of choices available to people for max protection.",kvbz9y
"In order to preserve my critical thinking capacity to figure out exactly what masks do and in what circumstances + to what extent they should be used. None of the studies we have (can't link to Twitter but you can see the charts going around) are of particularly high quality, let alone RCTs. Danmask was underwhelming. I am resolutely opposed to public health moralizing or turning masks into a political statement/symbol. 

My own personal mask practice, based on what I could gather, is as follows: 

1) Never ever outdoors alone. 

2) In grocery stores under low prevalence, outdoor distanced gatherings or crowded areas, walking through office hallways - cloth + double-layered MERV13 filter OR surgical. 

3) In what I judge to be high-risk indoor settings (grocery stores under high prevalence, haircut - only twice since March, dentist/doctor, being around handymen in my own home, airports/planes - still hypothetical, haven't traveled), KN95. I'm a college professor and if I ever return to in-person teaching, whether indoors or outdoors, I will use a KN95. 

Do I think if I actually came into extended contact with a highly infectious carrier in any of these settings any of these masks, even the KN95, would ""work"" to stop transmission?\* Probably not, to be honest. Maybe the inoculum theory has some weight. Maybe in marginal cases the mask confers a marginal benefit. Maybe these distinctions are pointless. You have to keep an open mind, otherwise your sanity and your soul will be lost. 

\*The common evidence about healthcare workers not getting infected all the time proving that masks work is misleading IMO. This study shows hospitals are not particularly conducive to spread due to masking: [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773128](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773128). But I'd say it might as well be due to better ventilation. And, if you really want to know my gut feeling, it could be that many patients are no longer that infectious by the time they get to the hospital in the inflammatory phase.",kvbz9y
"Thanks, I hadn't thought about particles being re-released. I assumed the idea was that you would inhale them off the mask somehow (?) or that you would touch the mask then touch your face.",kvbz9y
I'm in NC and they said they would refer to the CDC's recommended guidelines. So I'm not sure whether a college professor would meet one or both of their criteria.,kvbz9y
"""Some countries (eg the US) take evidence of past infection as equal to a negative PCR test""

Can you point us to info on that?",kvbz9y
" 

>You can still carry covid to someone via formite spread.

Though that's probably not a huge vector, so with some common-sense precautions (i.e., wash your hands and don't rub all over someone after rolling around the grocery store floor) you're probably good.",kvbz9y
"Thank you! That’s good to know. I’m in the US and they’re changing their rollout plan but I think it’s going to be for the better. Doesn’t seem like I should be worried about thousands of people getting their second dose late, I mean that would delay immunity but at least the first doses aren’t “wasted”",kvbz9y
"If one states that our policy is to trust science, the two should not be different. So is it dangerous to go beyond the trials? Vaccinating children … yes. Skipping (or risk skipping) the second dose? That was my question … does it simply delay immunity or does it mean starting all over … or do we simply not know?",kvbz9y
"Thanks for that answer! You seem to have some good insight. The E484K mutation seen in Brazil, SA, and Japan - does that compete with B.1.1.7, would it out compete it? Or could the B.1.1.7 also have get that mutation? The naming is very confusing.",kvbz9y
"So you’re just saying that the level of virus overall needs to be reduced to a significant level prior to lifting any distancing/masking protocol even with vaccines? It seems like that should be so much more prevalent of a statement. I agree, this needs to be way more concise when spoken by those in positions of power and guidance. It seems like vaccines will effectively do this job and they’re making it less digestible. The way some of them communicate it almost sounds like the vaccine is useless/redundant.",kvbz9y
"> They need to communicate this better because there's a lot of ""what's the point of the vaccine then"" talk.

Exactly my thoughts. Thanks for the answer.",kvbz9y
"This confuses people I think. They see the likelihood of diseases is less than 5% so this makes it seem that this￼increases the risk to 5%. 

It reduces your risk by 95%, not too 95%.",kvbz9y
"CoronaVac from Sinovac is an inactivated virus vaccine so it should have the N protein. Also, ImmunityBio’s weird Ad vector with S and N protein is in Phase I. Every other vaccine is spike based since it is the best immunogenic target for NAbs.

">he reasons why your country's numbers aren't going down could be numerous. Without knowing the prevalence of B117 there we can't say.

Netherlands. We've had very similar measures for a while now that, unlike in the first wave, just don't allow the virus to go down. It's frustrating that it doesn't follow a similar pattern. This just feels endless. I guess this isn't really the scope of this forum though. 

>he tldr for B117 is that it appears to be a substantially more transmissible variant,

Yes, I've seen this. But then how do they check for it? Why aren't we checking **more** for it? supposedly it's been in the UK for weeks before they even really knew about it... Doesn't that mean it should be everywhere, given how people travel and how much more infectious it is?",kvbz9y
"The study was clear that these rooms were being cleaned regularly, as far as I know the whole point of the study was to demonstrate that the cleaning they were doing was sufficient.

As for the fomite transmission, I don't know how you'd demonstrate that it's not happening without challenge trials since it would tend to be overshadowed by the much more common airborne transmission.",kvbz9y
"That estimated risk is misleading. What it's saying is that out in public, there is a 0.05% chance with every object you touch that it has a sufficient quantity of viable virus on it, a sufficient quantity is transferred to your skin, and that you then manage to get it into one of your face holes. It's not like, a 0.05% chance for _any_ object that may have been exposed to covid anywhere.

The second link there is one of the studies I mentioned that doesn't have data for temps between 4C and 22C, or for RH below 40%.",kvbz9y
"If I'm reading things correctly, the first link you posted is an article from April 2020 and the heading says, . . . lasts 7 days on a mask."" Your explanation regarding the exponential decrease is helpful. However, I'm guessing her fears won't be assuaged by that since we don't have clear data on how much virus is required to cause infection. 
I keep looking for more research on fomite transmission. It seems like because it is so difficult to remove confounding variables science moved on. I'm not sure why that has lead to health officials repeating that it is an unlikely transmission source. Additionally I would love to see more research on how much virus is required for transmission but again it would be very difficult to get clear data due to individual differences and environmental variables (plus ethics, we aren't going to intentionally give humans certain amounts of virus to see what sticks). 
 I want to be reassured on the fomite front but I just don't see it in the data. 

OP to reassure your gf, I would say that no one is perfect in their risk mitigation but the more you can do the better. Since she is likely being very safe in other ways she can count this as her small slip up and realize that the risk is low. Though the data doesn't show there is no risk I think the numbers are there for it to be much less of a worry.",kvbz9y
"I don’t think that is the case for most, check Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker. Once you remove the second dose numbers (times by 2 then minus from the total) it does not match at all.",kvbz9y

I had found a study from the UK that showed the CFR of primary and secondary Immunodeficency at 31.6% and 39.2%. I put the study name above bc I can't link. I was wondering why someone who has this condition or similar wouldn't be in an earlier phase like how the UK added high risk medical conditions to their 1st rounds.,kvbz9y
"I wasn't saying that age wasn't the highest risk just that I saw a study that found CFR that was higher than the CFR for 80+. I was just wondering why the CDC wouldn't add some medical conditions in with age that are high risk, like they have done in the UK, instead of putting high risk med issues in the 3rd round (1c).",kvbz9y
Oh no I absolutely get that and I see I didn't make myself clear. Sorry about that! I just keep hearing how hospitals are getting overrun and thought there had to be a better way? Especially when the UK seems to be prioritizing it that way..if that makes sense? But again Im not a scientist!,kvbz9y

"They are studies from outside of the US. There arent any I have seen by the CDC and some are condition specific.

I cant link for some reason but its called ""Covid-19 in patients with primary and secondary Immunodeficency: the United Kingdom experience."" 

That's just an example and I know its a rare condition but I've also seen that there are co-morbidities such as COPD and obesity that are considered high risk regardless of age. I know UK was vaccinating by age and medical condition first and it made me wonder why the difference in the US. But Im not a med or science professional so figured Id ask.",kvbz9y

"Nurses are not the limiting factor. In many locations, a county/state representative (depending on who is overseeing the distribution in that area) is required. This pool (a trained medical professional who is also on the county/state payroll) is much smaller. 

Further, this group is much more likely to be a 9-5 only type of crowd, either based on union contracts, past experience, or realities like child care availability. That doesn't mean everyone is, but if a county normally has 15 injection sites, that might drop to 3 or 4 after business hours. These same staff also need to be present if a large company wants to help with distribution (such as a meat packing plant with 3,000 employees who are all 1b), meaning that each time you try a new way to speed injections, you're closing off one of the previous avenues. 

States and counties are still terrified of wasted doses, or a mishandled negative reaction causing fear to spread throughout the community. Not sure what the answer is to this, these are very valid fears, but it is one of the major problems in the roll out and nobody seems to have a good answer as to how to solve it.",kvbz9y

"Yes, that's a good point.  Is it enough to conclude it's more infectious if it simply becomes the dominant strain?

"I haven’t found research on what you’re talking about specifically, but the reason i find this interesting is if you’re comparing three things: 

1. surgical mask (for filter)+ cloth mask (for fit)

2. cloth mask with replaceable filter 

3. surgical mask with mask fitter (e.g. fix the mask, uw badger seal)

the mask fitter is def the best option because the fabric will just reduce breathability making the mask less comfortable and push air around the outside. Even a surgical mask with some of those “mask hacks” you see are better than the cloth masks with filters. There’s a JAMA article by Clapp et. al. that compares those. 

one other note, fit varies so hugely based on face shape, so be sure to keep that in mind when you’re looking for masks!",kvbz9y

"It can be detected in two ways: via a failure in a standard PCR test resulting in one of the results missing (called an S-drop out) but that method includes ALL variants with an S-drop out, not just B117. Otherwise you need to sequence the genome of the virus. And yes, you're right: we need to be checking WAY more for it! Only the UK really has comprehensive genomic surveillance; they sequence about 10 percent of all positive tests. Public health experts have been calling for increased sequencing efforts for awhile now. And yes, it is probably all over the place now -- its been detected in dozens of countries. Whether or not it becomes dominant in those countries is another question, but we are seeing it become rapidly dominant in Ireland.",kvbz9y
"They aren't even looking anymore. They just don't have the tools to know the truth of this. 

Viruses almost certainly endure on fomites a lot longer in winter conditions. If one wants to see the difference in ambient spread, compare Florida to the northeast. Fomite transmission, like airborne transmission, probably happens a lot more indoors.

The numbers that are being repeated are out of context and have no meaning anyway, given the probability-of-success calculations involved in hundreds of surface contacts over many months.",kvbz9y

"You can catch COVID due to the virus shedding into your respiratory system. This process does not happen (or happens at an exceedingly low frequency) for blood borne cells like T cells and molecules like antibodies.

In the event that you would - somehow - receive antibodies in this way, the amount of antibodies you receive would be very low and unlikely to neutralize any meaningful amount of SARS-CoV-2.

For T cells, if you somehow received T cells in this way, they would almost immediately be destroyed by your immune system as they have a MHC signature that does not match your own MHC signature.

Say you went to a small church and sang with a lot of people for a few hours, one of the singers was a super-spreader, if you didn't get the vaccine, there was a 50% chance of getting sick, with a vaccine it goes down to 0.25%.",kvbz9y

">Southampton, UK – 13 January 2021: Synairgen plc (LSE: SNG), the respiratory drug discovery and development company, today announces that the first patient has been dosed in the UK as part of its global Phase III trial (SG018) evaluating Synairgen’s inhaled formulation of interferon beta-1a (SNG001), for the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients.

>As previously announced, Synairgen has appointed Parexel Biotech, a division of the leading global clinical research organisation, Parexel, to help conduct the Phase III trial and several UK sites have now been initiated, with further sites in the US and the EU expected to follow. The trial is deemed an Urgent Public Health study by the UK’s National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). In the US, SNG001 has been granted Fast Track status from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Company is seeking further equivalent prioritisations and support from governments in participating countries.

>Synairgen’s SG018 trial is a randomised placebo-controlled study being conducted in approximately 20 countries enrolling a total of 610 COVID-19 patients who require supplemental oxygen. After reporting the results for the primary and key secondary endpoints of the study, enrolled patients will continue to be assessed for long-COVID19 symptoms.

>Richard Marsden, CEO of Synairgen, commented: “We need treatments as well as vaccines to fight highly pathogenic viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Development of treatments like ours will remain necessary in cases where vaccines are not effective, for those who do not get vaccinated, and in case the virus mutates to the point where vaccines become less effective. We believe this trial presents an opportunity for a significant UK scientific breakthrough and, if given the right support, our drug could rapidly assist with the global crisis.”

>Synairgen is also running an ongoing Phase II trial of inhaled interferon beta in nonhospitalised ‘at risk’ patients, (SG016), that is progressing rapidly. For more information and to take part, visit www.covidtrialathome.com.",kwctwu
"Q from someone with little understanding of medical trials, why is it expected to take so long to get results (summer), when there are relatively few people in the trial?",kwctwu
"I feel like it’s difficult to start clinical trials for new therapeutics now due to the standard of care that can include stuff like antivirals, antibodies, and steroids and you would need a new drug that shows benefits on top of those things for success.",kwctwu
Great news. This long overlooked promising treatment is finally in Phase 3 trials.,kwctwu
"Not all the patients will take the treatment simultaneously, they're probably spread out over 2 to 3 months. After that, data analysis usually takes 1 or 2 months",kwctwu
"Well that's literally the purpose of these trials: to determine if a new treatment is better than what we have already. Sometimes the answer to that is no, because what we have already is pretty great. In this case, we don't have a ton of COVID-specific treatments that are shown to be particularly potent, so there's a lot of room for a new treatment to come in and knock our socks off.",kwctwu
"Given the acute need, and the fact there are only a few hundred on the trial, and so many thousands in hospital, why is the treatment spread out?",kwctwu
Wouldn’t it make more sense to test an antiviral in an outpatient setting rather than in a hospitalized setting where risk of failure is higher?,kwctwu
The company sponsoring the trial chooses the parameters and endpoints they believe most likely to be successful and provide the most benefit to patients. This company's internal data and data from previous phases apparently led them to believe that this is the setting most likely to yield positive results. Because the difference between good outcomes and bad outcomes are more stark in a hospital (moved into ICU/died vs. discharge) a study can get by with a smaller patient population to achieve statistical significance than an outpatient study where you're measuring something like O2 readings or temperature. It's also just way easier to run a study in the hospital because you have a captive audience and an existing infrastructure. All you have to do is recruit patients and record results.,kwctwu

"Abstract

The recently reported ″UK variant″ of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be more infectious than previously circulating strains as a result of several changes, including the N501Y mutation. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomains with and without the N501Y mutation, in complex with the VH fragment of the potent neutralizing antibody, VH -Fc ab8. The mutation results in localized structural perturbations near Y501, but VH -Fc ab8 retains the ability to bind and neutralize pseudotyped viruses expressing the N501Y mutant with efficiencies comparable to that of unmutated viruses. Our results show that despite the higher affinity of ACE2 for the N501Y mutant, it can still be neutralized efficiently by an antibody that binds epitopes in the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",kwiqnl
"Yeah, it is pretty clear now that N501Y by itself is not a concern in terms of reducing vaccine efficacy.  We still need a lot more data on the other mutations though, particularly E484K.",kwiqnl
