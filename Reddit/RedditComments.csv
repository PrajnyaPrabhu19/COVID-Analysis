"I was tested positive end of December after catching it at my hospital workplace, and spread it within my household. I'm young and fit, but was taken down by covid. After 10 days of hell I started to feel normal, besides calf cramps at night and still feeling chesty. I live with my parents, and really thought that they would be okay. They're in their 50s, are fit and have no co-morbidities, but my Mum is now in hospital where they're considering CPAP. I'm caring for my Dad at home, but he's worsening by the day. I am totally broken from this experience.",ktscoy
"My partner came home from work on Wednesday really upset that an electrician spent an hour in her tiny office space with no mask. The next day, he tested positive for covid. I am so beyond angry at his ignorance. 

We‚Äôre sleeping in separate rooms and wearing masks in the house, but we live in a two room apartment and self-quarantining as though we have it. Pulmonary Fibrosis runs in my family so I do all I can to keep my lungs healthy. Getting covid would be a real blow.

I woke up with a cough and a tickle in my chest this morning (Saturday), but it‚Äôs hard to tell what‚Äôs anxiety and what are real symptoms. Will get tested soon and report back.",ktscoy
Tested positive today. Feeling scared as my symptoms are only mild right now but everyone saying it‚Äôs gonna get worse. :(,ktscoy

"I should be getting my test results today but no ones called yet. I‚Äôm feeling a bit better, a lot less congested then I was and just mild chest pains now. Still no smell at all and I could taste apple juice a tiny bit this morning. I‚Äôve been taking vitamin c pills and Claritin.",ktscoy
"I got tested 6 days ago with my bf. Still no results for me, even though we got tested together at the same time and same place. He tested negative. He has had zero symptoms, but since 7 days ago, I have had a sore throat, cough, sinus pain, headache. My symptoms have basically been gone for two days now. 10 days ago we were both exposed to people who tested positive for covid. I shared drinks with one of the positive girls but he didn‚Äôt. Those girls were exposed to covid 2 days prior to us seeing them, so is it possible the virus wasn‚Äôt strong enough when we saw them and my symptoms are from something else?",ktscoy
"It‚Äôs been 2 months without my taste or smell. Lol I‚Äôm going crazy, I can‚Äôt even enjoy some chips and dip, forget about soup lol.",ktscoy
Did anyone else get a sensation of burning skin? My respiratory symptoms are pretty much gone. But now I‚Äôm left with severe fatigue soreness. And a feeling like I have a sunburn all over my body. Very bizarre.,ktscoy
"Omg please no. Besides the fatigue, the lack of taste and smell has been awful. It‚Äôs so disorienting and frustrating. I can‚Äôt imagine this lasting that long. I didn‚Äôt even think anything about ‚Äúlack of taste or smell‚Äù being that big of a deal until I actually lost it. Hope your senses come back!",ktscoy
"Sent my dad a pulse ox on Christmas Eve because he'd had a fever for 11 days and his doctor was telling him he should just ride it out at home. His levels were down to 88. He was admitted to the hospital that night and still hasn't been released. Internet research is usually a poor substitute for a medical degree and everyone should be listening to professionals, but don't hesitate to look out, and advocate, for yourself - even if your doctor doesn't seem too worried at the time.",ktcgcw
"last saturday when I tested positive I had a friend pick up one from walgreens for me because I had read the same thing, and she thought I was being dramatic.

A friendly reminder: Nail polish and pulse oxymeters don‚Äôt mix.  Not directed at anyone in particular.,ktcgcw
Yes!!! My aunt was convinced she would be fine. She got a pulse ox and when she texted us that it was 85 we begged her to go to the hospital. She insisted that she felt fine. She declined so fast in the next few hours that the hospital said she shouldn‚Äôt have survived.,ktcgcw
Thanks for the reminder! Just ordered mine.,ktcgcw
"The ‚Äúpulse‚Äù part is also super handy! My O2 was perfect all through my Covid illness and recovery so far this past month. But as I tried to get back to work at my very physical job I felt exhausted and noticed my heart rate jumping up to 100-135 just doing simple tasks, accompanied by  chest pain. With this info doctors were able to rule out lung problems, check my heart (which was all good) and give me a modified work note so I could go back to work on desk duty only. Monitor yourself as best you can, even if it doesn‚Äôt seem super important at the time, and it might help you later!",ktcgcw
" My cheap pulse oxs sucks tho and has given me a heart attack a few times. I may just have a lemon, but there is no way my pulse was 34 and my ox was 76 one minute...only to reset it, clip it again and have a 88 pulse and 98 ox. Ugh, thanks amazon.",ktcgcw
Mine has dipped down to 86 twice. Fortunately I didn't have chest pain or shortness of breath but it does dip down pretty low. I actually thought my pulse ox was broken after replacing the batteries twice so I bought a new one and still getting the same readings. I actually had to go to the ED last week because I started with bilateral ankle swelling which I've never had in my life. So between that and my O2 dropping I went in. They said I was a little dehydrated and they have seen the ankle swelling in some covid patients. My O2 dropped to 94 just laying in the stretcher and they said they weren't really concerned but wanted me to keep watching it. They said some severe covid cases drop to 80 and stay there. They said as long as it comes back up I should be okay. I'm just pacing myself these days and doubling up the vitamins and water.,ktcgcw
someone want to TLDR how your oxygen could drop that low and have no symptoms from it? Seems scary to me as someone who tested positive wednesday but has had only mild symptoms since Monday,ktcgcw
Welp... symptoms began Dec 28 and I just tested positive yesterday. I feel fine just tired and a little confused. Now I‚Äôm starting to panic that perhaps I‚Äôm too fine... I ordered an meter but it won‚Äôt be here till next week. Man I am panicking. I‚Äôm focusing on my breathing and freaking out because I‚Äôm paying too much attention now üò≠,ktcgcw

"I totally agree with this recommendation.  We got one in April just in the nick of time when my wife had come down with a severe case.   It arrived express mail on a Monday.  O2 was still in the mid to high 90s.   then it dropped scary low on Tuesday.  mid 80s, low 80s.   Got her to the ER right away.   She was in the hospital for 13 days.  At one point they had the ventilator parked right next to her bed but with Actemra, she turned out alright.

interestingly enough she as a healthcare worker, she got her first dose of the covid vaccine this week.  The following day, she got quite sick at home.  She felt flu like symptoms and developed a 101 temp.   Last (Thurs) night her oxygen dropped to 91.  I talked to an ID doc that I know and she told me one of her colleagues (also a former Covid patient) had the same kind of reaction.   She said it is NOT a second covid infection, her body is just fighting it too hard because she already has antibodies.   I decided to trust the doctor and she was right.  By Friday morning my wife's temp was 97.9 and her O2 was back up to 98.  She was eating normally, after having no appetite the day after the vaccine.   We seem to be in the clear now.",ktcgcw
Make sure it‚Äôs a good pulse ox. My dad bought a cheap one yesterday which showed mine at 90% then I used my uncle‚Äôs pulse ox which showed 98%,ktcgcw

"It's not just O2.

After 20+ days of managing COVID at home, my hr was shooting up 30 points point over in bed, up to 60 points upon standing. I was very hypertensive and spent three days inpatient.

Yes, low O2 is essential to monitor. Knowing I was dipping into the 70s motivated me to seek help as well. But the pulse rate is very, very important, too. The combo tells you a lot about how stressed your body/heart/lungs are.

"A pulse oximeter is crucial because of ""happy hypoxia"" - people may not realize how low their oxygen saturation levels are unless they check.

And the low oxygen is not just important because of low oxygen, but as an indicator that hyper inflammatory stage has started (typically starts day7-8 from first symptoms and rapidly gets worse and requires immediate mild to moderate steroids therapy).

At this stage Ivermectin etc can help, but it is steroids which is the most crucial and second aspirin or anti-coagulants as prescribed by a doctor.  Ivermectin helps at all stages, but it is steroids which is the life saver once oximeter levels start dropping.

This needs to be standard public service announcement to the public.  Yet there is a big gap here - and this really hampers early treatment.  And creates a situation where hospitals are turning away early cases but that just creates an endless supply of severe cases next week.

In some younger folks this inflammatory stage can be signaled by elevated pulse rate even when oxygen saturation seems normal at 98.  Pulse rates in such cases can be in 90s or 100+ at rest.  Once they start steroids it is immediately apparent as these indicators start going towards normal.

Public policy at this point should be to inform public to come in at day 7-8 from first symptoms to be given a short one week course of prednisolone.  This will result in zero deaths and fast recovery and low incidences of long-hauler syndrome.

----

If your oximeter readings are at 90 max or approaching that when you do activity you need to immediately see a doctor to start a steroids course.  A doctor in a clinic will do better than a big hospital as more responsive and faster response.

This is standard therapy post-day-8 when hyper inflammatory syndrome starts.  That and anti-coagulants.

You should ideally be on aspirin if nothing else and continue that for at least a month to prevent clotting risk.

Once it starts dropping it can keep getting worse.  Getting supplemental oxygen is not a cure.  Typically at your level a doctor may prescribe prednisolone 45mg for a week and then start tapering off - and do CRP, D-Dimer, Ferritin blood tests to ensure they inflammation has gone down.

Every day is crucial.

If you cannot go see a doctor, there are options for online consults.

Bought these for my entire family last January.  It is a shame our governments don't want us to be educated on this matter.,ktcgcw
"I've been having breathlessness at night, if anything this will help with me differentiate between my anxiety disorders and actual breathing issues. 
I had one lined up in a cart on my browser from earlier. Just ordered it. 


Thank you for the reminder! 
May your recovery be swift!",ktcgcw
"For infants, we've been using an Owlet monitor. It's a PulseOx in a sock. Comes with a base station that  has very loud alerts when O2 dips below a certain level. Brings a ton of peace of mind when sleeping; especially if COVID is going through the house.",ktcgcw
"A pulse ox is not a definitive measure of blood oxygen levels, it has a wide margin of error due to hands being cold, if your skin has a darker tone, and the amount of other gases like CO2 on the blood.  Buying one from Walgreens to ‚Äúmonitor your oxygen‚Äù is a waste of money.  You‚Äôll know you need to go to the ER if you have shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, or are presenting with other more severe symptoms.  Additionally a life long smoker or individual with COPD might consistently have low O2 levels at their baseline, again - a pulse ox on its own is a poor diagnostic tool and a layperson would probably be better off not ‚Äúmonitoring‚Äù with one.  The anxiety that hypochondriacs will give themselves every time their monitor drops a bit will be worse for their health.",ktcgcw
"I bought one for my parents when I was taking care of them. My mom uses hers everyday since she will be oxygen for awhile. If you live in an area with Instacart, you can order them from CVS or Walgreens! It may be faster than ordering online with shipping delays.",ktcgcw
You have coughing?,ktcgcw
That's scary I know I'm on like day fourteen or thirteen and it's getting old I'm so done with this. Did they admit you with your blood that low or just give you oxygen or what,ktcgcw
"Great advice! Also, if you‚Äôre having trouble getting a good reading or aren‚Äôt sure about your reading, you can use your thumb. I found that more reliable because it‚Äôs fatter and the sensor can pick up more data.",ktcgcw
"I just dropped my mom off at the ER tonight. Strangely, she is on day 15 and held mid to high 90s of O2 levels. Today it suddenly dipped and stayed between 90 and 92%. A Dr. friend thinks she and my dad have developed a type of pneumonia. I feel terrible.",ktcgcw

Thank you for the reminder. My nephew threw mine in the toilet so I need a new one. Lol,ktcgcw
"I left my damn pulse ox at work üôÑ I‚Äôm 8 days in as well an and just now I feel funny in my chest. My worst was day 1-2- fever but not even bad like 101 max but the chills made me think it was 104! I noticed my fingers and toes were so unbelievably cold too! No real point to my comment, I‚Äôm just amazing about the cold fingers and toes. It was weiiiiird.",ktcgcw
There are also a ton of apps that measure pulse ox. It‚Äôs fairly accurate.,ktcgcw
If you have a Samsung phone from the S5 to the Note 9 there's one on the back!,ktcgcw

I had low 90‚Äôs oxygen and did heavy breathing and the level went back up to 98.  Is it possible to deliberately keep your oxygen high by taking deep breaths?,ktcgcw
Can you add a link of which one you use ? Thanks,ktcgcw
My dad works in a place that is known to have lots of Covid cases and I found out today that he‚Äôs not feeling well. He said he‚Äôs has a bad headache for several hours. I just purchased a couple of pulse oximeters. One for me and one to drop off on my dads doorstep. I hope he doesn‚Äôt have Covid. He‚Äôs the type to stay away from doctors unless he‚Äôs forced to go. I‚Äôm hoping his work tells him he has to go see a doctor before coming back or at least get tested.,ktcgcw
how often do you check?,ktcgcw
"Thank you for the reminder. 

I've never had a COVID (antibody) test, but I've had COVID symptoms a few times during this and no, my family's never had a pulse ox on them, either. That coupled with how much more I've had memory/attention/cognition issues since about March of 2020 has really got me worried if I made myself worse by having hypoxia and never really knowing it. :(",ktcgcw
I got my entire family and friends oximeter for Christmas,ktcgcw
 I hope  you get better! üòä,ktcgcw
"For those of you who don‚Äôt have one, my son was in the NICU with severe RDS. The nurses abs doctors eventually told me to look at the baby, not the monitor (I just had covid and do have a pulse ox which I used). Watch for blue nail beds. If you‚Äôre hypoxic your fingers, toes, and lips just won‚Äôt look right.",ktcgcw
"Excellent point.  Low oxygen levels can be relatively silent, without the shortness of breath one might expect.  Somewhat different than other disease.  Monitoring oxygen levels can be helpful.",ktcgcw
Yep. Doctors told me I was mild and didn't need it. Ended up in the ER for chest pain and was surprised to see my pulse ox was low because I didn't feel much different and my nails/lips weren't blue.,ktcgcw
"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27089002/

Peer-reviewed article about which of the low-cost pulse oximeters available are actually accurate.  

Tldr - Two of the pulse oximeters tested (Contec CMS50DL and Beijing Choice C20) demonstrated ARMS of <3% at SaO2 between 70% and 100%, thereby meeting International Organization for Standardization (ISO) criteria for accuracy.

The first (Contec CMS50DL)  is available on Amazon for 20 bucks.",ktcgcw
100%. If we didn‚Äôt have one of these my Dad would probably still not be around today.,ktcgcw
What‚Äôs a good pulse ox you would recommend ? Trying to find one to help my dad with,ktcgcw
Can you use the Apple Watch series 6 as a reliable option?,ktcgcw
Very good advice! But don‚Äôt freak if you see readings in the high 80s; give the oximeter time to settle and breath out completely while you‚Äôre waiting. I had a moderate case from the 19th to the 2nd and first thing in the morning is time to cough up the fluid from the pneumonia and breath deeply to get the numbers up into the 90s. Now I‚Äôm waking to the mid90s and seeing 98 at times. Hang in there; God loves us.,ktcgcw
"I got one since having Covid around Xmas I been feeling what I can only describe as ""off"". The oxygen reading has been 99% consistently, but my pulse has been on the low side, below 60s and occasionally in the 40s. I thought it must be off, but I do feel ""weird"" all the time and had some of the symptoms like dizziness, nausea, and blurry vision. Idk.",ktcgcw
"I second that. I'm on day 32, entered hospital on day 25, having managed all my symptoms at home until my heart was effected.

I still am getting readings in the 80s regularly, although not for any extended time, thank goodness. My local hospitals don't give supplemental oxygen unless you're consistently under 89, btw, so I was out of luck on that point. 

How you feel does not correlate to how much oxygen you're getting.  A nurse at the hospital told me she had a totally normal conversation with a patient with O2 in the 30s - just before she had to vent him. üòü

COVID is one instance when trusting how you feel can be a very big mistake.",ktcgcw
Some cell phones have a pulse ox built in.,ktcgcw
"Gots the COVID. it's day (9?).

Pulse ox sold out everywhere on Maui.

The state has locked me away in a hotel, they forgot to give me the paperwork to leave the state... So... No idea if I can go home yet. I gotta wait till the state opens Monday.

So this is what communism feels like, huh? Disrespected and ignored.",ktcgcw
"I wonder, tho, how often your oxygen level dropped below 90% prior to you getting sick. A lot of times, patients don‚Äôt know that they have low oxygen or may have sleep apnea until they‚Äôre admitted in the hospital for a non-oxygen related event. Especially since you say yourself that you didn‚Äôt feel any change in how you were feeling.......",ktcgcw
I hope your dad makes a full recovery soon!,ktcgcw
I hope your dad recovers soon!! My mom had a very similar situation. Her doctor told her to stay home. I called her the day she went to the hospital and she fell asleep while talking to me on the phone. I made her call an ambulance and her oxygen was at 88. Even then they wanted her to stay home but she demanded to go and I‚Äôm thankful she did. I‚Äôm keeping your dad in my thoughts.,ktcgcw

> that could ~~damage me forever.~~ kill me,ktcgcw
I bet this is why they make you remove fake nails and nail polish before surgery!,ktcgcw
I'm confused. Is that because it reads through your nailbed?,ktcgcw
Thanks for the reminder.,ktcgcw
You can use your toe or even ear lobes as alternative sites!! Sometime you can turn the pulse ox sideways on the finger too so it reads from the fingers side to side rather than top to bottom.,ktcgcw
"Well I learned something new today, neat.",ktcgcw
I'm just confused if it drops below 90 how does one not feel different...like it should not feel normal,ktcgcw
Good! Hope you get to feeling better soon!,ktcgcw
"That happen with me too, what do you do to get the heart rate down and chest pain? I've been walking and doing breathe excercise",ktcgcw
"I have seen this as well - and it can happen in younger patients as well.

It is indicative of ongoing inflammation and a short course of prednisolone seems to help.

I have seen those with oximeter reading of 98 and pulse rate of 90s and 100+ see immediate benefit as they start first dose of steroids - for example like prednisolone someone 20mg tapering down to zero in 6 days.

This is what Dr Been uses for his long hauler syndrome patients as well.",ktcgcw
"Make sure you are sitting still and give it a minute or so before you trust the reading. They can be a bit finicky especially if the pulse ox is too big for your finger. Also take some vitamin D, countless studies show people with low levels of vitamin D have worse outcomes. I had COVID-19 late July and I'm convinced it was so mild due to supplementing vitamin D. Good luck and feel better soon!!!",ktcgcw
"Try putting it on your thumb, there‚Äôs more tissue there and it‚Äôs easier for it to pick up a reading. 

Also, replace the battery. Mine came with a battery back in March and the battery stopped working in December.",ktcgcw
"I have the same issue with mine -- it's come up 93 a few times, only to go back up to 99 if I either give it fifteen seconds or so, or if I remove it and immediately reapply it to the same finger. (at this point I'm recovered from a very mild case a while ago so there's no reason for it to be low)",ktcgcw
"Saying it has given you a ""heart attack"" is poor word choice here. Just say it scared you.",ktcgcw
"Look for ""silent hypoxia"" or ""happy hypoxia"" on your favourite search engine. But TDLR: you can be hypoxic without feeling it with covid. A study showed it was because covid sometimes targeted x receptor which was in charge of pain feelings. So everyone should get an oximeter. (Shame it's not widespread via mainstream health sites etc, in my country at least...)",ktcgcw
I believe this is called ‚Äúhappy hypoxia‚Äù and has been fairly common with COVID-19?,ktcgcw
Following. I'm in the same boat and totally freaked out.,ktcgcw
"If you are ventilating (exhaling) carbon dioxide just fine, you might not feel your oxygen deprivation. The main reason we are compelled to breathe is because we have too much carbon dioxide.",ktcgcw

It can‚Äôt hurt.,ktcgcw
"Everyone should get one just to monitor, you don't have to be staring at it every min, just check maybe every hr awake.",ktcgcw
Can you recommend one? I see 100s on Amazon.ca and literally have choice paralysis because they all look low quality,ktcgcw
The built in ones on phones are not supposed to be super reliable so be careful if you‚Äôre just using that!,ktcgcw
Amazon or any pharmacy but Amazon may take a while.,ktcgcw
Fluid build up in your lung prevents adequate gas exchange. Also o2 can drop if your laying on your back as this can prevent drainage. Patients should be sleeping on their stomach or at the very worst on their sides.,ktcgcw
"Nope, no cough",ktcgcw

"You can pick up a decent one at your pharmacy (CVS, etc) or big box store (Target, Walmart).",ktcgcw
No sorry but we are telling our telehealth patients to only come to the ER if they are below 90 for more than a few minutes (sustained). We are not able to handle the amount of patients who would show up to the ER with a pulse ox greater than 90%. It's not ideal but that is the reality of covid. Source: covid nurse,ktcgcw
"93% if for a consistent time. Make sure it's not cuz someone is moving, has cold hands or temp, or not placing finger correctly.",ktcgcw
This is misinformation,ktcgcw
Which makes it all the worse that hospitals in LA have had to only oxygenate patients up to 90% due to how overwhelmed they are. :(,ktcgcw
well that too but I figured that went without saying,ktcgcw
Ding ding ding,ktcgcw
It reads the amount of oxygen in your blood by passing light through the nailbed and measuring its absorption in the cells. Nail polish would reduce the light‚Äôs ability to get all the way through your finger.,ktcgcw
Steady low-grade depletion of oxygen can make us feel okay or even really good. People who scale Everest and run out of oxygen are often found to be in euphoric altered states before succumbing to the lack of oxygen.,ktcgcw
"Look up Happy Hypoxia. Many people with low oxygen levels feel fine. She also felt like she had the flu so she wasn‚Äôt feeling great, but it felt manageable.",ktcgcw
It's evolutionary. If you started to pass out the minute that you started to run out of oxygen you wouldn't be able to get yourself out of the circumstance. So being able to feel okay even though being deprived of oxygen for a short time is an advantage for survival.,ktcgcw
I have to stop what I am doing and rest to get the heart rate under control. Walking or doing anything at all raises it. So the doctor told me to be sedentary as possible for the next two weeks before I work up to doing normal things.,ktcgcw

They were kind and concerned, but there simply aren't the resources to give everyone O2 rn. And we know now COVID patients do ok with transient O2 drops. It feels bad, but it's survivable, unlike someone my nurse told me about who was talking to her with O2 in the 30s. Ofc he needs oxygen more than me.",ktcgcw

"This kind of early dismissal that just creates worse situations and more work down the line is something I have consistently seen with GPs in the UK, including one occasion where my son ended up hospitalised after we took him to A&E (after several GP visits where we were dismissed).

She also got super ill back in February with very high fever and feeling like shit. Always dismissed at the GP. At some point she couldn‚Äôt even walk to the bathroom. She would run out of breath. Now we think she had COVID19.

Myself was told I didn‚Äôt have a tumour on my back the size of two fucking tennis balls side by side. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing there‚Äù.

"This is not just an issue in the UK - but is systemic across the US and all countries.

Anywhere where there is a tightly controlled hospital environment adhering to protocol will be unable to change.

As a result the preexisting setup is unable to respond to changing landscape/understanding of a new disease.

For this reason I am seeing near universal inability of large hospitals to adapt.

And it is the independent doctor clinics which are freer to adapt - from what they hear from studies, but also just from making mistakes initially and then wowing not to make them with the next patients.

A large hospital system that has adapted is a rarity - an example is the Broward County, Florida hospital system which started using Ivermectin early because of the results some ICU doctors demonstrated.

However we have had MATH+ author Dr Paul Marik (a superstar of his hospital for his earlier work on sepsis treatment) and of Dr Pierre Kory who heads the FLCCC (that recommends the MATH+ protocol) - their difficulties with their employees are documented in this recent medpage article - see this thread:

"Essentially MATH+ is a recognition that live virus is dead by day 8 from first symptoms - for some it is earlier (day 1 of symptoms is the peak).

 This thus allows use of steroids at day 7-8 to prevent the hyper inflammatory storm which is building.

Ivermectin and other drugs help - but still some will need steroids at day 7-8.

As explained by MATH+ protocol from studies live virus is dead in all patients by day 8 - however the viral debris remains and continues to provoke the immune system.  It is this inflammatory response which kills the patient - as clotting factors are released etc. - blood vessels become leaky - and you start to see clotting and organ damage throughout the body.

It was the WHO which issued an erroneous warning against steroid use which hindered the early adoption of MATH+ everywhere - WHO later reversed after results of RECOVERY trial in the UK confirmed MATH+ assertion on steroids as lifesaver in second stage.

But the damage was done.  Now the MATH+ folks (FLCCC alliance) are trying to launch a second attempt and bringing ivermectin to public consciousness - but again there is pushback.",ktcgcw

I've been on them pre hospitalization, in hospital, and now again back at home, for nearly a month total. I hate being on steroids, but I have an ever increasing certainty they saved my life - so nice to know the logic behind it. Thanks!

(It never made sense to me that delaying their use was appropriate. That's as someone with a hx of asthma and pneumonia - drs don't wait in those circumstances, they treat ASAP, so why would COVID be different? Seems like sometimes we deliberately trip over our own feet.)",ktcgcw
Does that stand for Florida critical care clinicians or something similar?,ktcgcw
Do you take it with an cofactor like magnesium or k2 (for absorption),ktcgcw
">(It never made sense to me that delaying their use was appropriate. That's as someone with a hx of asthma and pneumonia - drs don't wait in those circumstances, they treat ASAP, so why would COVID be different? Seems like sometimes we deliberately trip over our own feet.)

The argument is similar to what the reasons were for opposing steroids by WHO and others in the first place.

You do not want to give steroids during the day1-8 viral phase.

Except where there is lack of awareness even among doctors is that the live virus is dead by day 8 of first symptoms for nearly all patients.  Which is why day 8 has been picked as the time to start aggressive steroids treatment.

The reason you don't want to give steroids in early viral phase is that you want body to aggressively eliminate the live virus as fast as possible and with as little total viral debris as possible (so that inflammatory triggers are less).

You want an aggressive immune response esp an early innate immune response.  Problem with steroids is they suppress both the innate and adaptive (that appears later and eliminates the last virus and that creates antibodies as well and long lasting immunity).

This is why according to MATH+ timing is important.

Treatment thus focuses on antivirals in first stage to limit viral expansion (and resulting debris), and steroids in second stage post-day-8 to control the hyper inflammation that is revving up and about to get worse in 2-3 days.

This is why as a patient it is important to understand first symptom - these can be as minute as cough, bodyache etc. for mild symptoms.  It is generally very clear in others.

If you were taking ivermectin prophylactically you may have very mild symptoms you don't notice.

I suspect there is a spectrum of symptomatic to asymptomatic and there is no black and white symptomatic/asymptomatic as is commonly portrayed.  That is, a lot of the so called asymptomatics probably will report slight symptoms if you ask them in detail.",ktcgcw

"My husband and I have been taking extra Vitamin D for years now and getting our levels checked. We first heard about this from Michael F. Holick who has a book called The Vitamin D Solution.

My husband had been prone to getting a bad bout of bronchitis at  least once every winter. I myself can remember a few bad chest colds where I would cough for weeks. Since we started taking extra D (my husband has been religious in keeping his levels 60-80ng) my husband has only had bronchitis once and I haven't had it at all in probably about 8 years since we started doing this. I must add that we also take the normal recommended daily dosage of Vit K (not extra) along with the D. I recommend looking into that if you take extra D and definitely check with your doctor first as Vit K,  I believe can cause a problem if you are on blood thinners. By no means do I think Vit D is a cure or preventative for Covid but I do think it can help your body be healthier and possibly fare better if you have Covid.",kts30h

Also, your calcium will be more absorbed if your vitamin D is higher, that‚Äôs good, and it‚Äôs why they fortify milk with vitamin D, but you don‚Äôt want calcium staying in your blood because that leads to plaque.

My personal anecdote is that I've been on \~8,000 D3 per day since last February, as an immune support. I didn't expect any 'side effects.' Hell, I didn't even read up on D at the time, so I had no idea what I might expect. But some time around mid May I woke up and suddenly realized that my aching arthritic hip and pissy ankle (old injury) hadn't bothered me in several weeks. The hip used to ache constantly, and would flare up several times a year in an agonizing attack. The ankle too would occasionally leave me hobbling around in pain. Now, almost a year later, both joints are vastly, VASTLY improved to the point that neither bothers me at all. The hip gets slightly sore if I go on a 5+ mile hike in the desert. For about three hours...  And the ankle is 99% 'transparent,' barely stiff a day or two per month.  I've lost a handful of pounds over the year, but my diet and everything else is unchanged, other than the 'mega' doses of D3.

"Im sending you all positive vibes for progression on your levels. Its really hard to understand how our bodies react to these vitamins. I was truly surprised and GRATEFUL amongst other things to know my body responded to the dose I was taking. I will retest in another 5 weeks and hope it goes up to 40 ng God willing. Once I started researching about vitamins D, I couldn't be swayed not to take.",kts30h
"D levels take a LONG time to rise. You won't reach steady-state for about three months.  50,000 per week is not that much, it's about what your skin would make if you whole-body sunbathed 1\~2 times, exposing both sides to the point that your skin got just a little pink. I don't want to sound like some crazed D zealot, but you could easily bump your dose by another 10,000 per day for a few weeks.",kts30h
This! I would have never thought I was deficient. Were you able to get yourblevels up?,kts30h
"Whenever I remember lol, but its it better to do it with a meal I have heard. I was just surprised my levels raised so quickly with such a smallish dosage",kts30h
"I haven‚Äôt had a followup vitamin D test yet, so I‚Äôm not sure how effective my method is compared to others, but here‚Äôs what I do:

(Started out with vitamin D level around 24ng I think)

I take a higher dose of supplemental vitamin D- 10,000iu. Yes, ten thousand lol.

I do that because I never remember to take it every day and my doctor was originally going to prescribe 50,000iu (as a shot, if I recall) once a week until my levels increased sufficiently.
I already had vitamin D supplement at home so I asked my doc if that would work instead. At first he hesitated because I think he assumed I had a low dose supplement of like 400iu-700iu or something.

But anyway, I take my 10,000iu usually anywhere from late morning to mid afternoon. I try not to take it after the sun goes down. 
I don‚Äôt have any scientific reason for that; it just made sense on my head.  

My psychiatrist once referred to vitamin D as having a positive effect on energy, but he‚Äôs not the type of doctor I would expect to know that sort of thing thoroughly.
FWIW, I‚Äôve never noticed any extra energy from vitamin D specifically, in all the years I‚Äôve supplemented it. 

But as always, your mileage may vary and check with your doctor or pharmacist before trying new things. üëç",kts30h
"Vitamin D is fat soluble, meaning it needs to be broken down and absorbed with fat so try to take it with food. That said, vitamin D also can alter melatonin levels short term so try to take it away from bedtime. With breakfast or lunch is perfect.",kts30h
idk but i always take vitamin stuff in morning so you process it during the day. don't really seem great or useful to be processing it at night. eating with meal with help it digest faster.,kts30h
"To add to OP, I‚Äôve read that taking it with something fatty (avocado, bacon, oils) helps absorption.",kts30h

Do you know your current levels,kts30h
"What's your rough age, weight and BMI?   If you're young, small and thin, 2000 may well do the trick.  If not, 2,000 is likely not enough.  (IMO, of course!)",kts30h
I take the one from the grocery store... nature valley. But I have seen some different ones on Amazon that look good! I think vitamin d3 is preferred over d2,kts30h
It depends what your current level is. But anywhere between 1000-4000 iu is recommended. I take 2000 iu,kts30h
"D3 is what you want. D2 doesn't work as well.  IMO, anything under 10,000 per day is going to be safe for any normal adult. Sunbathing in a suit until you get just a hint of skin color change (one MED) will generate 10,000 to 25,000 IU in just a few minutes.

And D levels respond very, very slowly, taking at least three months to level out following a dose increase.  If you want to ramp your levels more quickly, you'll need to take comparatively 'large' doses.  Keep in mind that 2,000 IU is 50 micro grams - millionths of a gram. A tiny speck smaller than a grain of sand. (Most of the pill is carrier oil of some sort.)

IMO, 4000 to \~10,000 is a good maintenance dose, depending on your age, weight, etc.  And doses up to 50,000 per day(!) are harmless for the vast majority of people.  At these doses, hypercalcemia can eventually become a problem if you take the stuff for months.  Anyone into the tens-of-thousands-per-day should certainly get tested after a while!",kts30h
"Vitamin D doesn't do anything in particular against covid, it's just an important vitamin for your immune system. 

So having a good immune system would therefore help with fighting covid, and you can do that by having sufficient important vitamins, one of them being vitamin D.",kts30h
I checked with my doctor before starting and I completely agree!,kts30h
"Horse poop.  An extremely small fraction of the population have bad reactions to D supplements.  Anyone just starting should take one pill a day for a short time, just to be safe. After that, D3 at 10,000 IU or more per day is 99.999999% safe if taken for a few months or less. Doctors routinely prescribe single doses of 100,000\~500,000 IU, or once-a-day doses of \~25,000+ to people who are deficient.",kts30h
What are you basing your advice on?,kts30h
"Or k2! It helps with absorption. I think I  credit such a large number jump in 5 weeks - going from insufficient to sufficient - to the cofactor. How old is your child? I really hope he/she bounces back quick. Consider taking melatonin and zinc too... tumeric if you have it you could make a tea with ginger. I was just talking to my mom how we have to prepare our bodies for covid. I honestly don't know if I have had it or not, but its possible given my vitamin routine that I had sinus issues I dismissed as covid. Its really hard to discern. How are you feeling?",kts30h

Yup I had covid. Still kinda do. Those vitas are helping me quite a bit. I started taking them 4 days after testing positive.,kts30h
"Wow, that sounds amazing. I wonder if it could have anything to do with the extra D. Have you gotten your levels tested to see where they are? I‚Äôve been taking about 4,000 in the winter and less in the summer since I‚Äôm fair skinned and swim quite a lot. The times I‚Äôve tested I wasn‚Äôt as high as the 60-80 range so I‚Äôve recently started taking 6,000 and will get my levels tested soon.",kts30h

"I agree. I'm not suggesting to not take a vitamin, just suggesting looking at a mix of ways to get more.",kts30h
"While it is indeed true that some people make vitamin D when exposed to the sun faster than others, there‚Äôs another factor that affects everyone: what hemisphere you live on and what time of year it is. 

[Here‚Äôs a super interesting study I found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5946282/) that discusses specifically U.K. latitudes and seasonal sun exposure/availability and the effect that has on vitamin D levels over time. 

The study was done specifically on people with white/light skin, so this obviously wouldn‚Äôt apply the same way for anyone with more melanin. 

As mentioned in comments above, the really clever human adaption of darker skin tones to protect from harmful sun radiation also translates into needing longer sun exposure to be able to produce sufficient levels of vitamin D. Fortunately, vitamin D supplements are pretty readily accessible most places. üëç",kts30h
"And make sure you go out mid day, with 2/3rds of your skin exposed!",kts30h
"Ha! Jokes on you. I live in Texas. 15 minutes is more than enough for a severe sunburn! :)

"Download the D-minder app. It tells you how much D you are getting exactly. It goes off weight, location, skin exposed, duration. Predicts future levels (always on spot for me when I get blood tested). You are also able to enter in supplements and vitamin D lamp sessions.",kts30h

It also matters whether or not you‚Äôre taking D2 or D3. 50k per week D2 is absorbed at a much less effective rate than the 2k D3 I‚Äôll be beginning.

"I am positive you can get them up if you remain consistent and get advice from the science and medical community. You're so close to being in a good range. I would remain positive and remember you can only do do much at once
 I totally wanted to go balls to the wall and start taking 5k iu, but I know it wasn't smart and would be a too much at one time for my body. Personally, 2000 iu can give me anxiety, so some days I only take 1000 iu. But who knows why it makes me feel that way.
So basically, my husband and I have been trying for a baby for quite some time. I was having 60+ day cycles and who knows if I was even ovulating. Once I got on a regimine, and started taking vitamins consistently, my period came back. We still aren't pregnant, but had the RE never taken the vit d test, I would have never known this was an issue. Im a sunshine lover and am always looking to bask. I just assumed I was good to go.

"Science by singular article is bad science, but even your article didn't claim anything that you are claiming. 

The article you cited wasn't a study, but just a hypothetical based on certain assumptions. That is to say - they haven't tested anything out, and their one-time 300.000 IU dosage for a minimum of 2-3 months is merely speculation (a fact they acknowledge in the article). By the way, a 300.000 dosage for 2-3 months comes out at 3-5k daily average - right around the safe upper limit. 

The fact remains that the daily upper limit that is safe for a non-deficient person is 4.000 IU. That doesn't mean someone can't take more than that, but it depends on their levels of vitamins, and should be a decision made in consultation with their physician, or at least they should know there is a risk and to keep an eye out on how those look like to prevent it getting worse.",kts30h

When people who speak, I felt like I was understanding their words a second late. Work started piling up & that just made me more anxious. This is something common among everyone my age (30) that I talked to who have had it. 

To help, I went on a few outdoor walks. Each longer than the last. After I started to feel even slightly present, I called a few friends. Reflexive motions mixed with new conversations pushed my brain just enough. I also picked up a SAD light & continued taking Vitamin D - anything to help me feel human again! A lil' bit of coffee also helps the situation - it isn't a miracle cure, but it does help some. 

Outside of these exercises & solutions, there's just time. I'm still not quite right & my last fever/obvious symptom was Dec. 20th. But every day is a bit more clear than the previous.",ktt8l4
I feel stupid and between the fog and headaches I convinced myself it‚Äôs brain cancer. I feel ya.,ktt8l4
"It‚Äôs a combo. 

The Covid itself messes up your sleep, leaves you foggy, tired, unmotivated. If it isn‚Äôt messing up your heart rate though you can sort of overcome that with enough coffee. 

Isolation plays a part too. I live in a rural area and unless you are used to it you‚Äôre used to socializing so if you‚Äôre used to it on a more regular basis you‚Äôll miss it. You do eventually adjust.",ktt8l4
"I too have those issues. I had loss of feeling inside my body and outside too. it feels like I'm a robot or playing a video game. it's an odd sensation thats a combination of isolation and stress and what I've read and been told by fellow Redditors is that its Depersonalization / derealization. there are more extreme cases than what we are experiencing but the symptoms are the closest match to anything I've read about so far. it usually resolves with time, from what I've read. I got sick on Dec 8th 2020 and still have issues starting projects and following long list of instructions and I work on, diagnose and repair computers for my job. its slowly getting better. for me. some get better sooner and some take a bit longer. I'm 48 and its taking me a bit longer.",ktt8l4
"I had that but it was more related to my nuclear-level sinus congestion. It also gave me vertigo. But also anxiety can cause disassociation, which is that feeling of kinda walking in a dream. So if you‚Äôre feeling anxiety it could be that too. Of course, if you have health anxiety, just the symptoms of anxiety can feed into your anxiety and make it worse.",ktt8l4
"Yes totally. My mother and I (both live in the same house, both currently have covid) are feeling like life isn't real.  It's such a trippy feeling. It pushes us to the verge of panic attacks.  I went for a short walk today outside and it snapped me back to reality, unfortunately after a couple hours of being back in the house I'm feeling the detached feelings again.",ktt8l4
"I have fibromyalgia.. it was so hard for me to tell what part of the fog was fibro, what was isolation and depression, and what was covid. But I DO know that fog and disconnection IS a symptom. For sure!",ktt8l4
"You‚Äôre not alone. I experience the same exact thing and I‚Äôm married. I struggled a lot at home and at work. Doing tasks that should take me a day took me weeks. I actually took some time off of work to get my head on straight. 

Meditation (I used the calm app every day for about a month in the beginning of the pandemic), therapy, and doing things I enjoy with no expectations have been helpful. Also setting boundaries on doom scrolling helps. Try to find grounding activities that bring you to the present moment. I hope that helps! ‚ù§Ô∏è",ktt8l4
"I was not able to type or surf the internet like normal early on, it was really bad. I forced myself to listen and read articles and watch videos to not get more brain fog.",ktt8l4
"I don't know how to fix it but you aren't alone. My 15 year old daughter and I actually both struggle with feeling detached, in a dream like state, or like this isn't reality instead it's some sort of surreal semi-reality and soon we'll snap out of it and we'll be back in our normal lives, back in the home we lost due to covid, her going to the school that we don't live close to anymore and me working my job that I am still on leave for after getting the initial termination status reversed... And our beloved kitty that passed away not long after I was sick for 6 weeks with the virus and was young and healthy before covid hit our home... It's really difficult for me to accept the detachment I feel with my life but I also realize that more than likely it's my subconscious mind protecting me from the grief and trauma of everything that's changed and all of the loss we've endured in such a short amount of time. 
I did try to connect with a telehealth therapist but I couldn't connect to her without face to face interaction, so I take it day by day, I keep a journal of how I'm feeling every day, because even though I was not contagious anymore way back at the end of September I'm still having new and different health issues from having covid and just the damage it's done physically and emotionally. Almost every article I've read lists brain fog as one of the main post covid issues people are dealing with having so I can't tell you what you should do but what I've done is the journal, frequent visits withy primary care physician, I accept help from the few loved ones in my life, I trust that my body is putting most of my energy into recovering from a brutal respiratory virus and when it says rest I rest, when it says eat or drink I do, and when it says stop isolating I reach out to you guys on reddit or one of my friends/family members, and finally I've cut myself a lot of slack. I'm not the type of person who feels comfortable not working all the time and pushing myself to be better, do better, ect. So this for a long time was a huge failure of mine and I beat myself up pretty bad for it. Until my first visit to the ER because I couldn't breathe. Mental health is a huge part of what your physical health is, and I am sad and scared and lonely and frustrated and feel stigmatized but I've also accepted that this is how it is going to be and take it day by day reminding myself that it's not my fault and to feel the uncomfortable feelings emotional and physical, and never minimize any of them. Good luck and I hope you are doing better but know that you are not at all alone.",ktt8l4
"I acquired covid last month and have also been struggling with brain fog. Although I do not recommend it as a universal solution, weed has helped to augment my interest in activities. It's compelled me to read and take up moderate exercise. I suspect that the documented anti-inflammatory properties of CBD are relevant to my improvement. I'm wary of the zeal with which people proclaim the benefits of CBD, so my judgment on it is based cautiously on personal experience, and hopefully not from too much placebo.

My perspective is that activity is crucial to neurogenesis. For me, the benefit of increased activity compensates for whatever risk weed poses.",ktt8l4

Yes i felt that way a number of times - trying to follow a cooking recipe was very hard,ktt8l4
"sounds like derealization, i have it too",ktt8l4
"I understand. I feel detached i just float through the day and can‚Äôt wait to go to bed to make it to the end of the 10 days. It may be my anxiety. I‚Äôm very unmotivated , don‚Äôt want to do anything.",ktt8l4
For me was the same. Exactly,ktt8l4
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derealization

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depersonalization-derealization_disorder

Traumatic events, intense stress, or prolonged stress can trigger episodes. 

I use to have episodes every winter and it would last 3 or 4 weeks, and a tell-tale thing for me is every light feels dimmer than it should be, like I can't make a room bright enough no matter how many lamps I put in it.",ktt8l4
"I‚Äôve been quarantining since Dec 19 because my mother tested positive and I‚Äôm in the same house. My work put me on a 14 + 10 quarantine (14 for her to not be infectious and then 10 as a close contact quarantine to make sure I didn‚Äôt catch it), then I started showing symptoms on the first day of the 10 days and tested positive. By the time I go back on the 18th, this will have been a hellacious month of quarantining. 

I don‚Äôt even know what day it is anymore and I just sleep constantly. I just took my first shower since Tuesday (not because of depression but because of shear exhaustion/fatigue) and feel like I‚Äôm made of lead. I‚Äôve never felt anything like this before. I‚Äôm just thankful my mother and I‚Äôve had only mild cases. I can handle fatigue and loss of taste/smell if it means that‚Äôs all we have to deal with.

My mom, around Christmas, when she was in the worst of it, said she ‚Äúfelt like she was floating in space.‚Äù I had no idea what she meant until I got it and had fatigue combined with missing two of my five senses. Now I know exactly what she was talking about. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm detached from reality right now. I didn‚Äôt feel this way until this week, two weeks into quarantining already so I don‚Äôt think it was isolation. I think, at least for us, it was the fatigue and loss of senses that did it.",ktt8l4
Do you have a pulse ox to check your oxygen level? Kinda sounds like low O2,ktt8l4
"I think it‚Äôs a combo of isolation, the illness, anxiety, etc. Having covid is a very weird time. Don‚Äôt plan to get anything done",ktt8l4
"Are you still recovering or is this after-recovery affects? 

Wishing you all the best. Keep going...",ktt8l4
I'm sorry to hear that but you should probably know that the world is not turning... everyone is under lockdown and the fools who aren't have created nothing but further disorder and chaos. It's a mess out here.,ktt8l4
"I‚Äôm sorry your feeling this way and I truly hope you lose this feeling. I understand part of it. I almost feel like I have a scarlet letter like I‚Äôm marked by covid and people are going to find me dirty or repulsive. I wonder if there‚Äôs more to come, if my mild symptoms are just a beginning.",ktt8l4
"I haven‚Äôt had covid, but I have really bad anxiety with panic attacks. I had my first panic attack after an allergic reaction to a medication. That reaction didn‚Äôt go away after a few hours... I went into a detached brain fog for months after, felt like nothing was real. The medication wasn‚Äôt even in my system anymore, but the trauma from it was persisting. I would forget whole days. Sometimes I would be home and forget how I got there or if I had eaten that day. I was terrified that I was going to be in this state forever and was constantly bargaining with who knows what to get the old me back. Nobody I talked to understood what was happening and kept trying to medicate me or send me to psychiatrists. It took a few months, but eventually, the detachment and brain fog became manageable. I‚Äôm thinking the same thing happened when you got covid. It sent you into this depersonalization. 

The point of me telling you all this is to let you know that feeling WILL go away and you‚Äôre not alone. I know it‚Äôs hard while you‚Äôre still sick, but try to think about anything besides covid. If you find yourself slipping into thoughts about it, do something to distract you. It can be something as simple as a shower while listening to guided mediation or watching little short funny videos. And you may have to focus all your energy on doing this for a little while. I really hope you start feeling better soon ‚ù§Ô∏è not just physically, but mentally too.",ktt8l4
"Sleep on your side or face down. Make sure you clean your environment with 70% alcohol at least twice a day - do not allow the bacteria to accumilate. You can help your body and lungs by cleaning and reducing the infection around you. You will be fine, hang in there. The fact that you can still type on here is a great sign!",ktt8l4
"I'm so sorry you're feeling this way, I went through a very similar feeling, from a dark place. During my 6 weeks of complete isolation I got so screwed up in the head that I started telling myself that I was getting to see how the world would be after I died and I got very depressed because it seemed like nothing missed a beat, that I had not left any significant impression in anyone's life to cause any change for anyone... Well I now understand that it was only because I wasn't actually dead but it did some damage to my emotional health and I still feel like I'm in a nightmare instead of reality. 
Right now I'm just numb, I honestly just take it day by day really not fully connecting with anything around me. It's a struggle, a very real feeling. In fact it might even be a lingering symptom of the virus, it's definitely done some bizarre physical damage, I would be remiss to not consider the emotional damage it's caused as well.",ktt8l4
look up Depersonalization / derealization and the symptoms should be similar albeit less severe.,ktt8l4
i feel ya,ktt8l4
"Yeah I‚Äôve had this constant headache and brain fog for a while now and I‚Äôve been convincing myself it‚Äôs a brain tumour or something, I just don‚Äôt understand why the headache doesn‚Äôt go away, it makes it difficult to do any uni work or assignments which is so frustrating as I‚Äôm in my final year. Doesn‚Äôt help I‚Äôve been in isolation with my family for weeks caring for them all as they‚Äôve not been improving from the virus since Boxing Day",ktt8l4
"‚ù§Ô∏è

Also maybe get a carbon monoxide detector",ktt8l4
"The doctor I spoke to involved with my place of employment during a phone call about leave stuff told me that the best thing he‚Äôd heard that helped other people who‚Äôd called him was to sit outside if you could, like on your front porch or a balcony if it wouldn‚Äôt put you near people. Even just opening a window and sitting near it to get some sunlight and fresh air would help put your mind at ease.",ktt8l4
"Sorry for the long post, I can just really relate",ktt8l4
I was ill the last two weeks of November. I am recovered but still feeling the after affects.,ktt8l4
Checking it out now. Thank you,ktt8l4
"I was just replying to another person‚Äôs comment in regards to this. I think COVID is creating depersonalization in people. We already know it messes with people‚Äôs brains by exacerbating anxiety. I see a lot of people saying they‚Äôre having symptoms of derealization, so I try to give them ‚Äúgrounding‚Äù techniques. Hoping it helps.",ktt8l4
"Sorry but your point number two is not accurate.  You are very capable of spreading it when you don‚Äôt have symptoms yet. Asymptomatic spread is one of the big reasons that this got so insanely out of control. People who think they are fine and not sick go out and do things without mass and without distance and spread it around to other people who do end up becoming sick.

Though it is true that often before you have symptoms you can get a false negative. That‚Äôs why testing as a way to say you don‚Äôt have it so you can go to some thing is not a great system.",ktwmi4

"Yikes, this is scary. I've had symptoms for 8 days but 2 negative tests and have sort of started writing it off, thinking maybe it's just the flu, but it's really hard not knowing whether to even trust the tests.

Edited to add: why did you see the Dr. at the various stages you did? I'm confused why they did the CTs if you weren't at the ER, basically. Maybe you are somewhere with better medical care than me.",ktwmi4
" China had a case where female patient was lab confirmed COVID with CAT scan but tested negative 11 times before finally testing positive, this paper showed CAT was most reliable method",ktwmi4
"I tested negative via PCR administered at urgent care, then positive via self-administered antigen 2 days later. I swabbed way higher up my nose myself for the antigen test than they did when they swabbed me for PCR. I truly wonder if that made any difference.",ktwmi4
"I was stating the _fact_ that in our case my wife started having symptoms 14 days after I did, and an estimated 21 days after I got infected.  The doctor‚Äôs explanation was that I had to develop enough of the virus.  That‚Äôs all.

A good friend of mine NEVER got sick.  He just did an antibody test two months after his wife and daughter were virus-free - no antibodies!  This is one weird virus.

And I agree 100% with the asymptomatic spread etc.  However, I was obviously NOT asymptomatic and my story is just different.  One would have expected her to get sick right away.",ktwmi4
Also the antibody test won‚Äôt necessarily be positive if you are asymptomatic. This test shows whether your body has mounted an adaptive immune response which takes at least a week. In mild cases (asymptomatic) this response can be too low to produce a positive test.,ktwmi4
"Well, the first 10 days are critical.  I saw the doctor on Day 1 the 101F fever started and started taking antibiotics - cant help the virus spreading but will subdue any budding opportunistic bacterial infections, which is the last thing you need while your body is feverishly trying to figure out just what the hell it is being attacked with.
Then the instant antigen test, and then a CT scan to confirm the worst fears. Then it all subsided for 7 days and then wave 2 hit real hard.

Again, this whole time I was taking dexamethasone, antibiotics and a drug called favipiravir (opinions differ on its actual effectiveness in stopping virus replication, but hey).  Feeling generally fine with just a mild ‚Äòfever‚Äô of 98.6.  All this time the virus wreaking havoc in my lungs and elsewhere.  Ct Scan day 3 = 10pct, CT Scan Day ~12 = 36 pct, at which point (along with cough, 38,6C fever and SpO2 dropping below 90) the docs strongly advised hospitalisation.

Symptoms are a really bad way to gauge what‚Äôs going on!

PS this in Russia",ktwmi4
"All the docs here say covid damages lung tissue in a very particular way - the frosted glass look. Reg X-ray won‚Äôt show it, MRT won‚Äôt show it, you can‚Äôt hear anything using a stethoscope, but once a doc sees the ct scan, it is 100% accurate.",ktwmi4
"Absolutely. When administering the antigen test, they‚Äôre basically scratching your brain :). If the stuff is there, it‚Äôs there, you can‚Äôt wash it down with a drink, cough it out, spit it out, etc, unlike the mouth PCR swab.

Beats me how you self-administered that :).  I was begging for mercy, full of tears ü§£",ktwmi4
That is fine that you want to share your specific story of what happened. But the way that you phrased it makes it sound like people who don‚Äôt have enough symptoms cannot spread the disease which is very very not true.,ktwmi4
"Yeah in the US they definitely won't give you a CT if you're positive. Like they will tell you not to come in, until you need the ER. So I am just stuck with that knowledge.",ktwmi4
"OHH, your PCR was a mouth swab! Mine was up the nose just like the antigen test. Now I gotcha.",ktwmi4
I do believe asymptomatic spread is real and is a huge problem given the virus‚Äô contagiousness despite it being irrelevant to my story.,ktwmi4
Agree...there is a lot of misinformation out there so we have to be careful in terms of anecdotes versus facts.,ktwmi4
"Yeah the whole time I was reading this I was just baffled at the comprehensive care involved. I had to pull my doctor's teeth to get just an x-ray done when I was still having breathing issues months into infection/recovery. I got ""just rest and take some ibuprofen, go to the ER if your O2 drops below 90.""",ktwmi4
"Oh, gotcha too now :)",ktwmi4
People have tested positive longer than 90 days. Most organizations say most people are no longer contagious after 10 or 14 days from onset. Most people go by whatever is convenient for their situation. After a heavy amount of reading over the past 10 months I'd say most people are no longer contagious after 14 days from onset. If your immune system is weak and or you had a very bad illness I think it might take a little longer. Most people on this sub tend to go by what the cdc says.  I personally believe that this isn't conservative enough.  The cdc has been slow and has fuct up numerous times. Also the tests are pretty much garbage especially the rapid test. Companies rushed to get these to market. My response will likely get down voted by the mob. I'd personally wait 14 days but I have long hauled since march and wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I gave someone this disease.  Take care and good luck!,ktvgkg
"I would wait until the 14th - just to be very cautious. And then, for this week, just wear a mask in the office/around the co-worker. According to just about every single expert opinion I've found, you aren't contagious 10 days after onset of symptoms. The issue, as others pointed out, is that if you get tested again (which many places won't even let you get tested twice within 21-28 days), you'll likely still test positive despite not being contagious or showing symptoms. 

I get that this person is being cautious. I've dealt with folks like that in my life. I haven't had a symptom since Dec. 20th yet people I know still look at me like I'm a super-spreader, hacking all over their mouths. The funny part is that some of these folks may have already had it, been asymptomatic & got past it without knowing! 

You're doing the right thing by isolating until you're in the clear by all professional measures. That's all you can do. It would be inhumane to force you into 120 days of isolation knowing full well you're not contagious.",ktvgkg
"Avoid going for second test at all cost this will complicate your iLife as you will test positive for a while yet .
Sounds like you have followed Public Health Guidelines and would be safe to return to work",ktvgkg
"I‚Äôll tell you what a Army medic told me me in August when I popped positive.

You will test positive anywhere from 60-120 days.

Lingering symptoms will stick for sometimes I still get some, I‚Äôm covid - now and I still get body aches or chills at times. 
Im tested weekly and I been - on every test.

It‚Äôs a slow process of getting better.

Army says you can‚Äôt spread it past 14 days.

Maybe it sounds stupid but im so grateful im alive. I know this virus is scary and taking lives. I just want to do everything with my kids. Its taught me not to take things for granted. I'm on day 7. I really want to get healthy.,ktz86u
I just want to eat everything when i get taste back lol but no really this definitely brought light to things I take for granted everyday.,ktz86u

Just bought a home boflex stepper and now I just look at it while I can‚Äôt breathe.  Can‚Äôt wait to workout again,ktz86u
i just tested positive today and i‚Äôm so depressed,ktz86u
"I am on day 17.   I remembered when my son had fever and I filled with dread that I failed to protect him from this.  Now that we both have recovered, we play soccer together everyday.  I started to read book to him every night too.  There is this sense of appreciation that I get to spend time with him.   We are still in Shelter in Place (California), I am hoping once it‚Äôs lifted, I can take him to build a snowman together.   I just cherish all these little moments with my son.",ktz86u
Start losing weight (I‚Äôve already lost a few lbs just because my appetite has changed with covid),ktz86u
I want to go for a walk with my dog. I want to take a long shower standing up and not in a shower chair. I want to bake. Everything I could do before. Everything. I literally can't walk to the bathroom without getting short of breath and having my heart rate go through the roof. Day 9 and I'm so sick of this.,ktz86u

"Cook and eat and walk for miles, but especially, I want to be grateful for whatever health I do regain. When I think of the pre-and post- Christmas junk I ate and the booze I drank because hey it's Christmas,  I could just kick myself. I'm craving actually eating and tasting a grilled chicken breast and caesar salad so bad....",ktz86u
"I want to take better care of my body. I know I‚Äôm blessed that I recovered and my family recovered well too. But I feel so much guilt, my cousins mother in law passed away from it, I had a aunt and uncle pass from it, and I just got news a distant cousin who is 22 is in the icu and she might not make it. I‚Äôm 28 and 260 lbs and it feels like I should be the one not making it instead of them who are so healthy. So I want to lose weight and become healthier. In a way, thank my body for fighting so well....",ktz86u
"I want to be able to go to sleep without the fear I will stop breathing, I want to sleep knowing my dad and sister who I know also have it are okay and not panic because they haven‚Äôt answered my text or call, I want to stop imagining the worst case scenarios, I want to get active, I‚Äôm religious and this time has made me cling to it more so get more into my faith.",ktz86u
"I appreciate my family so much more. I go over in my head how mean I was to my body. In quarantine I ate a lot and drank a lot and now I‚Äôm paying for it. I feel 2020 everyone lived the days like it was their lasts. There were no rules. Now I feel we‚Äôre all so thankful for those of us who came out of it alive that we will cherish our bodies and make sure to make it as healthy as possible again. When you‚Äôre sick you think of all the what if‚Äôs but more so the comebacks. When I‚Äôm healthy I‚Äôm going to eat better, when I‚Äôm healthy I‚Äôm going to love my family wholeheartedly, when I‚Äôm healthy I‚Äôm going to exercise, and so forth. I‚Äôm done complaining about life and so thankful to be here. It has brought me to my knees and I have more faith.",ktz86u

But they're closed where I live",ktz86u
I want to learn how to skateboard!,ktz86u
I know it‚Äôs probably stupid but I just want to eat something and taste it again. Or be able to take a shower without feeling like I‚Äôm going fall out from fatigue.,ktz86u
"Cook and taste and go for a run/ walk, shower, clean, not wear feel like a threat",ktz86u
"I want to be able to drink without having my tonsils swell up lol. Also I want to get a handle on my anxiety, it‚Äôs out of control and deeply affecting my quality of life. I‚Äôve already recovered from covid though, had it last month",ktz86u
"I'm fresh out of Covid and the first thing I did was eat a burger. But I feel like I haven't recovered the will to live besides that. Covid was all about survival, right now I feel a bit empty. But I can't wait to want to do things again, and do anything else (but especially finish a personal project! Something that gives me that sense of accomplishment)",ktz86u

But stare is shut AF",ktz86u
"I‚Äôm really thankful I didn‚Äôt spread it to any family members, especially the older ones. I‚Äôm usually really careful but clearly this virus has a mind of its own, so I feel lucky I‚Äôm still alive despite experiencing nearly all the symptoms (I‚Äôm on day 13). It‚Äôs definitely made me realise that I can‚Äôt take anything for granted, especially smelling and tasting food! When I feel better I‚Äôm going to make sure I eat slower, healthier and appreciate all the flavours. Exercise more often (when I‚Äôm not so out of breath). Spend more quality time with loved ones and friends. I‚Äôm also going to be more organised and make sure I pursue all my career goals in time this year, because clearly life is short and there‚Äôs no time to waste.",ktz86u

I just want to get back to my apartment and start working out and be able to smell again. I was at my parents house when I got it. I‚Äôve been here for about a week or 2. I go back to school next week.,ktz86u
"We went through it during Christmas. We have four kids. Now it just feels so good to take them to the park and do all of the normal things. You‚Äôre not alone, you‚Äôll get through it. Every day is different and it‚Äôs not always perfect but it‚Äôs better than what you‚Äôre (probably) dealing with right now. Hang in there.",ktz86u
It has been a wake up call to just how bad my immune system is. My wife recovered in days and I‚Äôve been at this for at least 10+ with it still beating me up. Says a lot about our overall health. Makes me want to treat my body better so that I can be there for my kids.,ktz86u
We have a special meal reserved for when we can fully taste again. Just about 85% of the way back. I feel like I‚Äôm a lucky individual that can still enjoy food through this. I only had a couple of days where it was like I was eating texture (fatty foods were like eating butter and it was gross).,ktz86u

We also got some new exercise equipment and it just mocks me. I‚Äôm in no rush though. I‚Äôm excited to get back to it when it makes sense for my body.,ktz86u
"I‚Äôm really sorry. The anxiety and depression have been the worst part. I‚Äôve never been good at being sick, but especially when I‚Äôm having to isolate. I‚Äôve already been much more isolated over the last 9 months but this is so much more than that. It has taken my motivation and hope. Each day is a little different. Some better than others. I‚Äôm trying to focus on my mental health and keeping myself afloat. I‚Äôve felt a bit dazed today, but my symptoms have been kept at bay most of the day aside from exhaustion and light congestion. Some aches. Just look at each day you‚Äôre at home and managing symptoms on your own as a blessing. There are people who can‚Äôt even do that and stand no chance.",ktz86u

This is beautiful. I‚Äôm glad to hear the positive side of things. I wish you lots of great memories with your son!,ktz86u
Losing weight has been a big deal for me this year. I only imagine it would‚Äôve been worse than it is if I hadn‚Äôt lost as much as I did. I highly encourage you to keep up the journey!,ktz86u
"The winded feeling sucks so bad. I would get dizzy in the shower and just hold the walls. My heart rate has been high, but I mostly blame my anxiety. It‚Äôs been 20-30bpm higher on average. I‚Äôve been ‚Äútaking it easy‚Äù to avoid pushing too much. Can‚Äôt wait till it settles back down.",ktz86u
Eat what you can until you get through this. Keep up vitamins. Be happy. I have actually found myself eating leaner as a result of this too. Just wanted to keep it cleaner.,ktz86u
"Don‚Äôt beat yourself up over any of it. Life is life. Enjoy it. I had been craving a salad really bad and had one tonight. Couldn‚Äôt enjoy it. Ate half, threw the rest out. Even though I‚Äôm getting my sense of taste back, it‚Äôs not fully there and some stuff just isn‚Äôt hitting like it used to.",ktz86u
"I know you‚Äôre feeling guilty, but you can‚Äôt carry the weight of all that on yourself. I‚Äôm not far from your age and the odds are greatly in our favor. Taking care of what we have now we‚Äôll be good long term. There‚Äôs no telling what we face in the future, but what we do for our health now can really make the difference later. Good luck and wish your family peace.",ktz86u
Hold to your faith and worry about your recovery. They‚Äôll forgive you for missing a call. How bad is your breathing? Do you have an O2 sensor? Maybe someone could drop one off for you? That would give you a ton of peace for sleep. I have one next to me at night and check it to ensure I know I‚Äôm okay. Even if it fluctuates I know I it goes back up.,ktz86u
My squat rack is calling my name. I miss it!,ktz86u

"Thanks for that. But there is a well-defined line between enjoying and gluttony,  and I routinely find reasons to jump over it and justify way too much.

"I am sorry for the position you are in.  I hope your dad improves.  Speaking as a nurse you are doing all the right things.  Encouraging him to keep fighting is the best thing.  We have so many patients who deteriorate because they don't want to prone or get up or do their breathing exercisies.  Medicine can only do so much, patients have to help their body fight.

It is very doubtful they will let you visit.  Every hospital is different but most I have seen will only allow a visit if death is imminent. Some places even then it's only face time.",ktpbib

Make sure if he‚Äôs offered any clinical trials he‚Äôs to say yes as these can work wonders sometimes and there haven‚Äôt been any that have had any negative affects.

He'll be okay. I promise. Just gotta be patient and ride this out.,ktpbib
"My mum was in the same situation - same age and also has BP. We managed to treat her from home. She got really bad at one point, she also gave up (mentally) but we forced her to stand up, walk around for a few minutes every day, drink water, vitamin D, we made sure she got some fresh air, we also cleaned the house with alcohol religiously (most important part if you ask me). 

I've been reading about this shit for a long time now and to my understanding, even perfectly healthy people die from covid because it also depends on exposure. You have to ensure you are not exposed to it for a long time and once you contract it, you have to make sure you are cleaning (killing the bacteria) everyday and not allowing it to accumilate. 

I think this is probably all handled by the hospital. The best thing you can do atm is to show that you really care for him. Morale is pretty important. Don't let him mentally give up. You've got this.",ktpbib
I‚Äôm almost 3 weeks since testing positive on 12/21 and totally lost taste / smell the next day. It‚Äôs about 80% back now and seems to be slowly strengthening on a daily basis.,ktykim

First 2 weeks pretty much complete loss of smell,and of course appetite (that's a scary part),started coming back slowly.

It's 3 weeks now and it  has improved, not a 100% but  last couple days  have showed a marked improvement.",ktykim
"It‚Äôs great that your smell is coming back! I was without smell/taste for about 2 weeks, and when smell started coming back, taste lagged behind a few days in terms of recovery.

I‚Äôm only 5 days in and I have the same fears. Also 29. If I lose this sense forever I‚Äôd be completely devastated and would not know how to cope.,ktykim
"I‚Äôm posting my experience in a lot of similar smell/taste threads just in case it helps someone else:

I only lost taste and smell for 2 days, but as soon as it happened I started eating and drinking only anti-inflammatory foods/beverages. I was dumping turmeric and black pepper in green tea with honey, eating cherry tomatoes, raspberries, saut√©ed beets, yellow & purple potatoes, pomegranate juice, the works. I even ate cloves of raw garlic.

I‚Äôm not some health food fanatic, and I can‚Äôt really say for certain whether this is what helped it come back so quickly, but my roommate who also caught covid didn‚Äôt eat quite so healthy, and his smell & taste are still not great after 2 weeks. My senses have gone back to normal (tested positive 12/29).

Obviously, this experience is purely anecdotal, but an anti-inflammatory diet may help recover those senses faster.",ktykim
"My cousin said it took him about 3 weeks. I'm hoping that by this time next week, I can actually have some taste back. I've made a lot of progress with smell. Hoping that taste catches up.",ktykim

It doesn't sound like that long but it feels ages to her",ktykim

"I have moderate asthma and never needed oxygen or anything like that. I was held in the hospital as a precaution because of my asthma but didn‚Äôt need to be there.  My blood oxygen was never below a 94. To compare, I was hospitalized with the flu back in February and actually needed oxygen then when my levels hit 91.

"We caught it from someone who didn't know they had it, 2 days before they developed symptoms. Thank you, you too. Oh, my 15 year old handled it very well, I'm hopeful yours will too x",ktw6g7
"I have zero idea where my daughter got it. We are super careful and haven‚Äôt been around anyone other than each other and if we are out we wear masks and aren‚Äôt in crowds. My kids are homeschooled. Basically We‚Äôve only been to store. My daughter says she feels normal now minus taste and smell. In the beginning she sounded ‚Äúnasally‚Äù then she was really tired and had headaches. She didn‚Äôt cough, run fever or have body aches. Kids are 3,6,13,15 and 17. My 6 year old did have a super mild cough for a day or 2 but that‚Äôs it. Do you guys have the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù symptoms?",ktw6g7
"That's sounds just like my 15 year old minus the headaches.

My son and I are on day 8 and feel OK. 80% better. My husband is on day 7 and is still suffering with evening fevers and terrible headaches. 

We all had it quite differently. No fevers, (apart from hub) sore throat, tight chest, stuffy snotty nose, occasional cough, feeling mega rubbish. It just seems to go on and on. So tired of it now. I suffer with anxiety and worrying about my husband is getting to me now!

Take care, I'm around if you wanna ask anything in coming days x",ktw6g7
"Thank you I appreciate it! 

I hear you on the anxiety. Hope your husband feels better in the coming days. 

I‚Äôm starting to think maybe the rest of us are safe or asymptomatic.  I feel like we should‚Äôve gotten it by now if we were going to.",ktw6g7
"It can show up as long as 14 days from exposure. But as you're close together, you would think it would show by now. I really hope it doesn't! Thank you x",ktw6g7
Are you guys improving? So far no one else is sick here. Mine and my husband pcr test came back negative. We were tested the day after my daughter tested positive. She had been sick approx 5 days before being tested though.,ktw6g7
"Hi, yes, my son and I are about 95% better! My husband turned a corner too and just feels like he has a head cold, he's about 85% better. We do tire easily though.

That's great news that none of you have caught it from her! Hope she is back to normal soon  x",ktw6g7
So glad you all are doing better!!,ktw6g7
"I have no idea.  The only place I could think of is the vet office.  I have a disabled dog that needs his weekly therapy so I went there with my N95 mask and sanitize everything.

Other than this, I am baffled.  I wfh and didn‚Äôt even go grocery shopping.  Another possibility will be the delivery and I touched my face/nose frequently from the surface contamination.",ktw5o1
"I had surgery on 12/30. Supposed to be outpatient, but they kept me for observation overnight. Private room, OR and room in separate building from COVID patients and ER. I was released exactly 24 hours after I arrived. 

After Midnight on 1/2 I started with diarrhea, headache, cough, sore throat. I thought it was my body reacting to the general anesthesia and being intubated. These symptoms continued on and off until Tuesday am, when I started feeling better, more energy, no more headache.
Before I got the surgery, I had scheduled a covid test (PCR) for 1/5 just to give me peace of mind. Came back positive. I was stunned and isolated in a separate room/bathroom immediately after getting the result. My family is testing today. I feel so sad and guilty for exposing them. 

Now my symptoms are congestion and some soreness in my throat. Lost my sense of smell Friday 1/8. Hoping for a mild case.

My only outings were the preop test at the hospital drive through on 1/27, the hospital for surgery, and the test I took post op on 1/5. Definitely hospital acquired.",ktw5o1
"My boyfriend. He got sick but had a neg pcr test so I came over to take care of him‚Äîthen I got sick. He then got a rapid and tested positive, and 3 days later we both tested positive (pcr). He‚Äôs been going nowhere but the grocery store so that‚Äôs probably where he picked it up.",ktw5o1
My wife is a teacher. She is basically forced to work in close quarters with people. It was only a matter of time.,ktw5o1
"Work. Some stupid girl I work with doesn‚Äôt wear her mask ever. Her family was covid positive and yet she still came to work. The last time I worked with her I remember telling her how I really couldn‚Äôt get covid because I‚Äôm immunocompromised. I tested positive 5 days ago and today is the first day that I have remotely felt like I could leave my bed.

I have not eaten in 2 days. I‚Äôve lost 7 lbs. I‚Äôve had mostly gastrointestinal symptoms with the occasionally shortness of breath after walking my dogs (with a mask so I don‚Äôt contaminate anyone) I have on/off headaches but no fever in 24 hours. 

I‚Äôve never been more upset at an individual before.",ktw5o1

"I‚Äôm in MN and our schools are all about to open up. Our cases have come down from their peak and have reached a plateau at around 2000-2500 new cases/day. I am less concerned for children catching Covid and more concerned for teachers and staff. Truthfully we had very few school transmitted Covid outbreaks in our school this past fall, almost all cases were attributed to community spread outside the classroom. I believe this is why they are trying to open schools right now.

As far as children fairing through the illness, the vast majority due very well and recover completely. If your child has a risk factor due to a preexisting condition I would be more concerned. I can try and find some studies, but I will say @kinggutterbaby and @jessicamalatyrivera on Instagram are both WONDERFUL Covid resources.

Full disclosure, I have 4 children ages 3-10 and we have decided to do full distance learning this year because it is working for our family and we won‚Äôt get vaccinated for a long time because we are all very low risk. But I do believe school is a safe place for children at this point, especially if your school is being upfront with outbreak numbers and strictly following CDC guidelines.

"My 3rd grader has been doing in person learning in public school since August and to date only 3 cases have been reported.  Of those 1 was and in person student and 2 where remote only learners and never entered the building.  Now to counter that my nephew goes to another public elementary school across town and they had 13 cases.  However spread was contained to 4 cohort groups so it didn‚Äôt get far.  When we switched to remote learning 2 weeks before winter break I was told it was because of a teacher shortage because teachers where being quarantined for potential exposures originating outside of the school and there where not enough substitutes to cover their absence.  We start in person learning again on the 19th.

I am blessed to have them helping me by leaving food and drink outside my door but man this sucks ass. But the panic is real and it‚Äôs intense. Thanks again for sharing, it made me feel less alone as I navigate through this. Btw, the ER didn‚Äôt test me either and I was there a week ago and sure I had it then.

I totally get that you are anxious, i was too very anxious and unwell but it went well away, was able ro walk normally again after 2 weeks post-climax of symptoms and was able to work again one month after my symptoms started (M22, semi-fit)

If you only have the O2 lines in the nose and it's not at jetspeed, just give it some time (3-5 ish more days). Alwaya remember, it's normal to be worried or anxious but most likely, you will be just fine again in two weeks timeüòÅ

On the medical intervention spectrum, 3L is really not much.

Chaplains are pretty great people and can help you work through some anxiety. Maybe you can talk to one over your room phone if you feel well enough? (imo, it really doesn't matter if you're religious/spiritual or not).",kt4p58

X-rays and CT scans showed viral Covid pneumonia and I‚Äôm on albuterol and last day today of steroid treatment .  O2 was low to mid 90‚Äôs. The prone position sleeping on your stomach was and is a huge help. Breathing is still shallow for me but much better today then yesterday. The doctors said use the inhaler, change positions and move around. There‚Äôs nothing else to do right now but get through each day because progress is made, just takes time. I will say a hot shower proved to make my breathing more uncomfortable which caused a panic so for what it‚Äôs worth just a heads up. You‚Äôll get through it.",kt4p58

"I was in the hospital in a high care unit and I was scared when I first went in; fever of 104 and oxygen levels at about 87-90. I was very sick for about three days and then I was given the combination remdesivir and plasma transfusion. After that I made a really good turn around, within 24 hours I was cognitive and could talk coherently.

"You‚Äôre young and strong, you‚Äôll get through this. The reason this disease is so tough on older folks is because age really takes a lot of your vitality, which makes recovery so much more difficult. Your lungs and body have the strength to recover, it just takes some time. And during that time the added oxygen will give you the additional support to allow you to overcome this, so your body doesn‚Äôt have to work so hard.   Make sure you rest and eat to maintain your strength and you‚Äôll be fine very soon. Good luck to you.",kt4p58

I‚Äôm 3 months out now and feel close to normal. I have some mild post-viral stuff, but I‚Äôm keeping a positive outlook about it.

I don‚Äôt know if this would help you but I‚Äôve been using sleep stories to help me sleep when I‚Äôm anxious or my mind won‚Äôt stop racing.

Also, rubbing a mixture of coconut oil and a couple of drops of lavender oil on my chest helps me with anxiety too. Idk if the nurses can get you that but it would be helpful.

"Hello friend. I just recovered from a very easy case of Covid, I know I am very fortunate. I have been in the hospital for extended periods of time, some for asthma. Here is my helpful tip for you. Work on your anxiety. Your stress level being high will only make you sicker. I would highly recommend healing meditations and focusing on your breath. I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound too new age to you, but I can not tell you how useful these tools have been to me. Even when I was stuck in a hospital room with Francine (God bless her heart) who had some major stomach issues and screamed out ‚ÄúHELLLLLLOOOOO‚Äù to me every 30 minutes. I got through that, so that‚Äôs proof it works. 
Best wishes and put that magical brain to work healing your body. Take care.

"Hi! Sending you such love and positive vibes. I just got out of the hospital myself (tonight)! Like you, I also initially tested positive on the 27th. 

Take a deep breath - you are in the safest place you can be right now - with smart people who are working their hardest to help your body heal. When machines beep and go crazy with low ox and high heart beat alerts, remember that you‚Äôre being monitored 24/7. The meds you‚Äôre receiving are going to help give your body the help it needs to get over this hump. You‚Äôve got this, you are strong, and your body is resilient. 

I asked every single nurse I had over my 3 day stay about their covid experience and one said she landed the ICU for 5 earlier this year. And there she was, valiantly back on the covid ward helping us heal. If she can go through hell and back - so can you! You‚Äôve got this. 

Wishing you a speedy recovery and good strong meds, friend!",kt4p58
"My mom was admitted on Jan 1 with covid pneumonia. By the 4th she was in ICU. On the 5th she was placed on a ventilator. She's got a high chance of survival because she's making solid progress daily. It's hella nerve wracking but I do want to share one thing with you.

On Day 2 she was on the phone telling who knows how many people her story and building up her anxiety causing her oxygen levels to drop significantly until she was no longer conscious.  I know that her nerves and her cabin fever made her get in her own way. Please, whatever you do, be calm and remember that you're a strong individual with good numbers and it is just letting your body rest.  Make sure to eat what they give you as nutrients are important for fighting this virus. 

My dad went in on the same day as my mom and he came home after 3 days. He went in, did his time, watched a lot of TV, ate when they fed him and he's home on a 2L oxygen. 

You will get better. While the numbers are not ideal, they aren't the worst. You simply must exercise patience and let your body do what it has to do to get better.  I have faith in you. Be patient and if you need to, ask the nursing staff for paper and write all the things you want to do when you're healthy. Journal therapy is really good for anxiety too.

I hope you get home soon.",kt4p58

I think because of all the media hype and because people have died from it and knowing that and testing positive takes a huge mental toll on you more than the physical aspects and symptoms of having covid. I know it did for me.

It is stressful I won't lie. You're not alone though and I know it's tough right now and will probably seem like forever until you're well and things can be somewhat normal again but you will get through it I promise. I did.

They are finding people's cytokines and chemokines are out of wack.  Myocarditis and other organ damage is being reported.. this fuckin virus is horrible.  You can be healthy and young and it hurts you too. It's a flip of the genetic coin.,kt0qvf
"This is rather common. Years after the 1918 ""Spanish"" Flu Pandemic, they discovered it had long term affects for your Cardiovascular System, Heart and Brain! Many many people who thought it was no Big Deal if they catch this virus are gonna find out they were wrong.",kt0qvf
Yes! Lots more headaches and nausea after covid. Also sense of taste and smell have never been the same yet.,kt0qvf
Yes oh my god! I get so many weird feelings in my heart and body and am so scared of what the long term affects are gonna be! Will we not live as long? Will this be life threatening in just a few years? It‚Äôs so scary. I just feel so physically and mentally exhausted.,kt0qvf
"I know exactly how you feel and I want to offer some perspective...

I got sick with the measles when I was 6 years old. I had received a bad vaccine along with other kids in my area. And some infected person brought measles into the region and I got it.

I was so young but I knew after recovering from that that my body was never the same. What I didn‚Äôt know until 20 years later was that I had lupus.

Between measles triggering my lupus and my diagnosis at age 26, I went through years of getting sick from lupus flares or having a more difficult time with getting over colds or a bad flu a few times. Every time I got sick, I never felt like I fully healed. I felt like my health bar was never allowed to return to 100% since I was 6 years old. And each episode of sickness continued to reduce that health bar‚Äôs range.

Some people with long covid are saying that it takes 6-12 months to recover. Given my medical history, I‚Äôm not sure how that‚Äôs gonna play out for me.",kt0qvf
It‚Äôs called post-acute covid-19 syndrome.,kt0qvf
"i constantly have a headache now, and i get short of breath so easily. it‚Äôs terrifying.",kt0qvf
There's a whole sub for that called covid long haulers.,kt0qvf
"I am pretty sure i had it last january in seattle.  What you describe is exactly what i experienced.  I felt like i aged 20 years in a week.  Arthritic, weak, constant brain fog so i suddenly felt like an idiot at my job in engineering.  It seemed like it would relapse every 3 to 4 weeks for a couple of months.  It took a couple of months to feel somewhat normal again.",kt0qvf
When I had covid I never got chest pains or had trouble breathing much but now I struggle to breath even when I‚Äôm just laying down it‚Äôs weird and I feel like my body‚Äôs much weaker now strength wise.,kt0qvf
So it attacks your central nervous system in some cases. Likely is the inflammation around our nerves making everything screwy. Could be awhile before all of that inflammation goes down. I think it was a John Hopkins or Harvard article I read about it. If I can find it again I‚Äôll link it.,kt0qvf
"Yes. I so appreciate other people discussing this. It feels like my friends and family sorta think I‚Äôm being dramatic. I‚Äôm getting scared. Its almost scary to even talk about it, because it gets more real. It‚Äôs been 3 full weeks since my positive test. The first week was awful. Then the new reality set in. 

So, I‚Äôm wondering about physical exertion and what it does to one‚Äôs body after Covid. Normally, after an illness, I start getting active again, and it helps me recover. Three times now, I‚Äôve gone for a mild hike. I mean...like a baby hike and not at a quick pace either. I get the shortness of breath, but not that badly. *However*, the day following these short hikes, I feel like *crap*. I go back to chest pains, leg pains, and absolute wipeout. The exhaustion isn‚Äôt only physical. I get mentally exhausted from exerting myself. Neurological symptoms have been the worse part of Covid (nerve pain, smell/taste, vision, hearing, balance), and those all come back again. It‚Äôs like my brain gets inflamed and rejects the activity. I get punished for it.

What do we do? I‚Äôm at a loss!! My doc won‚Äôt even see me. Who can help us? I‚Äôm an RN, and I have no idea. I was working in a Covid unit. I definitely can‚Äôt work like this! Those shifts are long! Sometimes, I feel like I‚Äôm gonna pass out from standing too long.",kt0qvf
"I was definitely feeling that way, but after 3 acupuncture sessions since, I am starting to feel a lot more normal. The brain fog is receding, the temperature regulation is coming back, and I am not nearly so tired. 

I also started a Whole 30- I was going to anyway, but I decided I really wanted to give myself lots of nutrients right now, and that has made me feel a lot better too. 

I still don't feel all the way right, but less like a stranger in my body and more like getting over a really long illness, like a very bad flu.",kt0qvf
"Yes, you had a major infection from a virus your body was na√Øve to. You didn't say how long it had been since initial onset of symptoms. Any major infection can take the body a number of weeks of follow-up recovery. Organ function can take time to fully recover. Its important to continue to get as must rest as you can and avoid things like alcohol that tax your organs.",kt0qvf
"Yes, this! Insomnia despite being exhausted most of the time, and I go from cold to hot in an instant. And I‚Äôm still waiting for taste/smell to return.",kt0qvf
M19 here. Fell the same way. I can‚Äôt exercise the same way anymore. Especially strength training but also cardio. My taste and smell never came back and I feel weak almost everyday. School work has become especially difficult because I get fatigued so quickly,kt0qvf
YES!!! I have never had sinus issues but man do i have them now. I've had non-stop postnasal drip since October.   I also have a stupid dry cough.,kt0qvf
"Got sick during the last week of March and it took me about 3 weeks to be able to function somewhat normally again, but I still don't feel how I did before I got sick. It definitely feels like the virus never really left my body.

After getting sick, I noticed my migraines got worse and I had new brain fog and chest tightness to deal with on a daily basis. My fever even came back randomly one day after being fever-free for about a month. It's frustrating to try to have other people believe that my chest tightness and other issues aren't due to anxiety (both improve a lot when I take tylenol). 

Overall most of my symptoms have gotten better, but I still have chest tightness every day and I notice that anything that would normally make my migraines worse, like emotional stress, dehydration, anxiety, and certain dietary triggers like excess caffeine, also exacerbates my chest tightness and brain fog. Meditation and other techniques to manage my anxiety have helped a lot though.",kt0qvf
"I got Covid 4 weeks ago and I felt some muscle weakness and noticed a bit of an occasional elevated heart rate, but other than that, no I feel completely back to normal",kt0qvf
"Fear not my friend. They are calling thos post covid syndrome AKA covid longhaulers. Doctors are starting to recognize this as a condition and starting to learn to treat it. Why don't you get an appointment with your doctor to examine you. Also, go the the longhaulersubreddit for more info my friend",kt0qvf
It's been over 6 months since recovery for me and it completely wrecked my digestive system and I'm quite certain I've developed POTS from it where my heartrate is always elevated from simple tasks if I'm on my feet I am always tired and fatigued.,kt0qvf
"I tested positive 15 days ago. I‚Äôm still tired a lot of the time. I slept 11 hours last night and all I can think about it getting back in bed. My eyes have that fatigued feeling everyday. I also haven‚Äôt been able to taste or smell since I tested positive. That might be the most annoying symptom I‚Äôve had. Overall, it‚Äôs definitely made me feel mentally and physically different and I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on why.",kt0qvf
"I‚Äôm almost positive I had it in the beginning of last year before it was shown we really did have huge outbreaks here in the US...I got extremely sick and since then even as of NOW I feel sick all the time. My body is weak, I have super bad breathing issues that no doctor can explain quite yet despite doing all tests except the last one I am getting done the end of January, and on top of that I‚Äôm extremely weak some days while others I barely manage to get work, school and working out done. Some days I can‚Äôt even work out because I feel like I‚Äôm going to faint. If nothing is being picked up on scans and tests then I am almost sure it‚Äôs just a huge variety of after affects that still are clinging onto me. I was such an active person and barely drank and smoke...mind you I‚Äôm only 21.",kt0qvf

"Dude same, had it between June/November. Feel off, and get brain fogs a lot more often. It helps to keep a schedule though. If it wasn‚Äôt for my calendar in my room I‚Äôd completely lose track of time. 

I‚Äôm worried about long term effects, but because I don‚Äôt have insurance I can‚Äôt see a doc to give me a checkup without spending so much money.",kt0qvf
"I (25 F) had covid 50 days ago and I still have swollen lymph nodes, muscle pain and general fatigue, I‚Äôm scheduled to have a neck ultrasound to see if it‚Äôs related to something else.

Edit: feel like I should say it was a very mild case of covid.",kt0qvf
"I had covid from the 20th of December and other than a few days of a mild fever and fatigue I felt absolutely fine. Lost my sense of smell/taste on the 25th for 5 days then it came back. I'm 22 male and once I found out I was positive I supplemented vitamin c, zinc, N acetyl cysteine and 0.3mcg of melatonin at night for a week. Couple days into supplementing all my symptoms disappeared and I felt normal. Have had no after effects and luckily infected nobody I know",kt0qvf
Sounds like dysautonomia- autonomic dysfunction. Seems to be common in long haulers. Hopefully with time your system will reset.,kt0qvf
"F40. My mom passed in Sept and then I had covid in Nov. Lately I find myself more short tempered than i used to be, less patient, less accepting, more judgemental. I am on an antidepressant and I kind of assumed that I'm dealing with the remaining grief and the usual work stress of this time of year. But it's getting bad. Now I'm starting to wonder if covid messed up my brain a little.",kt0qvf
"I get headaches very easily now and have been having a hard time regulating my own temp. Either freezing and cannot get warm or sweating and taking my clothes off overnight. I was barely even sick with covid in early November. My bf and I are both still struggling with exhaustion, not nearly as bad as it was but were both finding 8 hours of sleep to be our bare minimum necessary to function",kt0qvf
I guess I am one of the lucky ones. I got it in July but now in January I am feeling no effects. And I am 74 years old with several underlying conditions. Of course I cannot rule out some symptoms showing up in the future.,kt0qvf
"Yes, but I'm not sure whether I'm being paranoid or not. Things I've noticed:

* My heart beat is stronger and more noticeable (particularly at night)
* My face flushes more (particularly at night)
* Aches and mild joint pain
* Feeling tired at random times during the day
* Feeling breathless after light exercise (possibly due to decreased exercise in general though since lockdown)
* Feeling increasingly depressed with bouts of anxiety
* No energy at all in the morning (I used to wake up at 6:30 to leave at 7:30 for work starting at 9 but I struggle to get out of bed for 8:45 now for a 9am start working from home)
* Increased appetite, despite having a reduced appetite while having COVID, and being on a diet beforehand (although Christmas not long after didn't help)",kt0qvf
"I am so relieved to read others comments. 12/7 was my onset date, a week later hospitalized with sepsis and Covid pneumonia. I feel like everyone is like ‚Äúso you feel better?‚Äù, and they don‚Äôt get it. Sure, I feel great I‚Äôm not hospitalized with a 103 temp, but I‚Äôm short of breath with the most mild activity, my head literally feels like it‚Äôs stuffed with cotton balls making my thoughts fuzzy, and a headache a constant in my life. I‚Äôm exhausted, and could nap multiple times during the day. Worst is I can‚Äôt recall anything, my
memory is shot. CT scan still shows ‚Äúground glass opacities‚Äù in my lungs, but I‚Äôve been told that it‚Äôs just gonna take time. Really? Cause I feel like a guinea pig for the medical field, making the fact I am a nurse leaves me insulted. I‚Äôm terrified of catching a common cold or flu.
I saw a quote that seems to fit ‚ÄúI am the virus‚Äù. 
Thank you for the opportunity to rant.",kt0qvf
"Check out long haulers. I have 2 family members that got it back in March and still aren‚Äôt right. One is in a study with Yale. She was an ED nurse so she got a heavier viral load.

She‚Äôs been told it‚Äôs left long term damage to her neurological and vascular system. And for some reason her pituitary gland isn‚Äôt functioning correctly.

Long term symptoms are a thing. I have a cough that comes up whenever I eat and it‚Äôs been over a week since I tested negative. Unfortunately since this is a new thing we‚Äôre not definitely sure how to treat or cure it :(,kt0qvf
"i remember reading something about the virus hitting the hypothalamus, the body's thermostat. you can research that.

Yes!! I feel like I can never get comfortable enough to fall asleep. My body just always feels tight and stiff... I just don‚Äôt sleep like I used to. I‚Äôve also continued to have congestion in my ears. Finally taking a steroid which seems to be helping. I had covid almost 3 months ago,kt0qvf
"It takes a long time to feel normal. But you will, don‚Äôt worry! My boyfriend and I had it in March and I think it took us probably 6 months to stop questioning how we felt and get back to 100%.

"I‚Äôm currently recovering at home after 5 days in the hospital (came home 12/30). I‚Äôm feeling better other than the fatigue, occasional cough, and shortness of breath.

I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm going to faint or anything. It‚Äôs just really weird to me. Also, my sleep has been horrible. For example, Went to bed Thursday night at 10:30 pm. Woke up at 1:30 am and didn‚Äôt fall asleep until 5:00 am. Woke up again at 7:30 and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep. I have a follow up Dr appt on Monday, so I will be bringing this up.",kt0qvf

"Yes, while I‚Äôm mostly fine, there are some things off. I get tension headaches all the time now, and have had a lot more floater/bright spots in my vision.

I‚Äôm like 90% sure I got Covid in the end of March but they were only testing the sickest of the sick at that time. But I didn‚Äôt start ‚Äúsignificantly improving‚Äù until the beginning of July. 

You should ask an online doctor if he thinks a course of prednisone would be helpful. After my course of prednisone it seemed to ‚Äúreset‚Äù my out-of-wack, hyperactive immune system (e.g. my hands would flare up with welts and burn & itch and feel like road rash when exposed to sunlight. My lungs would flare up from the slightest irritant. I thought I was going to die after grilling steaks outside one time). And from then on I started slowly ‚Äúreturning to normal.‚Äù Around late September I felt as if I was 95% back to normal.

"I don't dismiss actual lingering effects, but I think a lot of issues come from not knowing the answer. I've been very stressed and anxious after recovering and still have chest pains.

Having COVID and reading countless articles of the pain it bring definitely doesn't help.

Try to think positively and ease back into a normal lifestyle. I too used to workout 3 times a week (lifting) and I stopped for over a month. I felt a lack of confidence as I was always feeling tired and weak. But, today I finally got back into it and I made my goals. Some of it may be mind over matter.

Have you tested negative?,kt0qvf
"First off I am so sorry for your loss. I know how hard a loss of a loved one can be especially during these times. Second I 100% know how you feel about the mental toll of Covid! I am way more irritable, angrier, less patient, etc! I hope you feel better soon and again I am so sorry for your loss.",kt0qvf
"I'm so sorry to hear about your mom passing. üòî 

What you describe happened to me, too. It feels like I've been taken over by a different person since I got sick. I get angry so quickly and have zero patience. I can't feel much of anything beyond frustration, restlessness, anger, and fatigue.",kt0qvf
WOW...Thats incredible! I am glad you are doing so well!!,kt0qvf
"YES TO EVERYTHING JUST SAID!!! Me too. Heart beat  beating louder, flushier face, aches, random tiredness, breathlessness, anxiety/depression, no energy, and increased appetite! I can relate to all of this!!",kt0qvf

SAME!!!,kt0qvf
Ive been tested twice...both said neg so Im assuming they were true but you never know!!,kt0qvf
Ive been taking a fee vitamins thats all though! My diet use to be calories based (limiting to 1500 a day) but since covid thats gone out the window!,kt0qvf
I would 100% get tested! Better know for sure than speculate! Whatever is wrong I hope you feel better and get through it!!,kt0qvf
"Lol I was not stressed out before I got covid.
Never had these problems before
Doctors recommended me to just excercise and eat and drink water, they don't really have a medicine to treat it because usually that means one has a serious case and need to go to hospital,
But because there's no medicine who knows how long it take to recover",kt0qvf
"I was reading that there is kind of a PTSD associated with having COVID that many survivors experience. As a MH professional, have you seen that?

I think many people with COVID feel alone and abandoned. There is a lot of anxiety associated with having the disease, and when your case is mild the only information you‚Äôre given pretty much is to isolate for 10 days and go to the ER if you have breathing issues. People then experience a myriad of symptoms in no particular order with no idea if they have any implications on the course of the disease. All of this generates tons of anxiety in a lot of people which can have a long-term effect. I don‚Äôt discount Long COVID either (it‚Äôs definitely real), but a lot of my symptoms went away when I was able to effectively deal with my anxiety.",kt0qvf
"Hey now, there‚Äôs no reason to be angry at people for asking questions here. Some people recover from covid without seeming to have any long term issues either so it‚Äôs a big mix... and unfortunately we still don‚Äôt know that much about it.

It‚Äôs a very terrifying virus.

I think it‚Äôs a positive step that the OP reached out to see if anyone else had a similar problem experience given how new this is.",kt0qvf
I did everything right!!!! I followed every rule! The only reason I got it was because my father brought it into our home! Its not like I can not live with my family! (im only 16) The worse part is he had no symptoms and felt fine! My mom and I on the other hand are dealing with his mistakes!!,kt0qvf
My anxiety got worse and not I‚Äôm hyper focused on my body too which doesn‚Äôt help. I feel like an old person. I‚Äôve been trying to tell my managers at work this and they don‚Äôt seem to understand.. but I‚Äôve told them I need to be on light duty cause I don‚Äôt wanna die cause who knows the long term effects of this!!,kt0qvf
"Focus on your symptoms and try to see what you can do, yes it's hard cuz my symptoms haven't gone away either.",kt0qvf
You are probably both suffering from post viral syndromes.,kt0qvf
Yes. I started shaking this off 7 weeks out after all tests ruled out issues.,kt0qvf
Exercise has been nonexistent since I tested positive.....Im hoping to slowly get back into it! Hope you guys fully recover soon!,kt0qvf
Covid brain! He‚Äôs like myself and many others. My doctor calls it Covid brain and can last a long while after the initial infection. I feel like I‚Äôm on a merry-go-round all the time and sometimes have to put a hand on the wall when I try to go to sleep to prove to my brain I‚Äôm not spinning.,kt0qvf
I had the heart palpitations for a long time too!! But now it‚Äôs been 9 months and they‚Äôre gone.,kt0qvf
I'm 9+ months and absolutely have that still. Just not as bad.,kt0qvf
"Thank you, you too! üòÄ",kt0qvf
People don‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm a healthy guy in my late 20‚Äôs. And now I get random headaches all the time. Sending you good energy your way and health. Have a nice day dude!,kt0qvf
"37/38m no pre existing conditions.. I had mild pneumonia in left lung.  Hospital didn't keep me. never needed o2.  Real bad gi, never had a cough, lots of tremors, red burning hands, red eyes, insomnia, brain fog, elevated tsh (damage to thyroid), and tachycardia.. still have most of this..although the acute period was about 2 weeks and felt like a weird fuct up flu.. not really like a flu and not really like a cold.. been stuck at about 85% until a recent relapse dropped me back down considerably. On beta blockers and a little ativan to sleep. Wild ride.",kt0qvf
I've seen doctors.  I was given beta blockers for my heart and have follow up testing.  The doctors don't know.  Most are of the opinion that we will eventually recover but no one knows for certain.  Most of the people who had sars and mers recovered in 12 to 24 months. I was 37m healthy fit and never had medical issues in the past either. It sucks having a chronic health condition I feel bad for everyone who suffers from one.  I definitely took my health for granted.,kt0qvf
"Not that you can do much now, but early on my brother and I scoped out who in the family was actually being safe and who wasn't, to actively avoid being near people (and unfortunately their immediate bubbles) who weren't being as observant of guidelines. Everyone can make their own choices, it's just unfortunate when they politicize the issue with their ignorance and separate households from any semblance of seeing each other, even distanced with masks....",kt0qvf
Same here.  The headache is weird.  Like a hole in the forehead.,kt0qvf
"Thank you so much for the advice, I‚Äôm only 16 so i‚Äôm sure i‚Äôll be fine. and i‚Äôll try not to worry as much but i‚Äôve always had bad anxiety and this whole thing makes it so much worse. That persons reply definitely worsened it seeing as i am still suffering from some of the symptoms including slight chest pains (Probably just anxiety) and what not but yours has put my mind at some ease.",kt0qvf
"First of all, none of what you said is actually based on any real scientific findings. The virus hasn‚Äôt been around long enough for us to know that yet. 
Second, that‚Äôs a really rude and messed up thing to say to anyone, and especially someone that‚Äôs already experiencing anxiety over it.",kt0qvf
"i wish you a speedy recovery, it is terrifying. it‚Äôs not fun at all.",kt0qvf
"Reading these comments make me feel so unfairly lucky. I've had 0 lasting effects from the Coronavirus and my time being infected was pretty easy, no worse than a common cold. 

I truly hope that you can make a full recovery some day. You shouldn't have to suffer for other people's carelessness.",kt0qvf
I hope we do too. have you had problems with your feet? I mean like them being cold all the time but sweating at the same time? I feel like this never happened before and then after covid it happens to me everyday.,kt0qvf
"I‚Äôm going to see a functional medicine doc next week. It‚Äôs super hard for me to wrap my head about that lol. It‚Äôs a whole different approach, but I‚Äôm willing to try it!",kt0qvf
Thank you!,kt0qvf
Thanks man! Hope all goes well. Could always look into supplements to see if anything could help,kt0qvf
No. Buy that's not the guidance in my country. After 10 days self isolation and no symptoms I can leave quarantine,kt0qvf
Thanks.,kt0qvf
At least I can cross the paranoia off the list lol,kt0qvf
Thank you! We‚Äôre all on edge because we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs around the corner. One thing I can say is that they both are still experiencing to this day is the fatigue after menial tasks. Hope things start to get better with you as well. Hang in there!,kt0qvf
"and don't listen to all this stress response, psychosomatic, hystera bullshit. it's just a decades old way for doctors to blow off their patients. this is a physical illness with empirically documented long term effects on the body. take what you are going through seriously even if they don't.",kt0qvf
"I also feel pain in the back of my skull and it travels down to the side of my face to my ear and jaw. 
I‚Äôve been to the chiropractor thinking it‚Äôs a pinched nerve or something. But I also wake up still congested sometimes so I wonder if it‚Äôs sinuses.",kt0qvf
"Its not pain that I'm feeling, its the dizziness. It almost feels like my cerebral fluid is sloshing around back there.",kt0qvf
"Ugh, I know! I have one right now. Mine either last from a half-hour to all day, and I can't find out what's triggering them. It starts out with pain in the back of my neck. Hopefully, you recover as well!",kt0qvf
"Please do and keep an eye on it. Your symptoms remind me of my sleep apnea before I was treated and my o2 was low cause I‚Äôd forget to breathe. It sounds like the post Covid symptoms cause similar problems with issues in your lungs. If you see it dip too low you‚Äôll definitely wanna follow up with your doctor 

I hope it is something that gets better and soon!",kt0qvf
"I‚Äôd maybe try quercetine, glutathione, zinc, C, D. Maybe you can get a blood panel to see where your levels are at as far as vitamins.",kt0qvf
"I really need to. Godspeed, friend.",kt0qvf
"Yes, I have seen this in some of my clients (not all) and experienced myself as well. It's important to remember that COVID does not ""go away"" once the fever or cough stop (or smell and taste return). COVID still looms over our heads and we don't know what to expect next. The thing about stress response, is that it effects our Central Nervous System whether we are actively thinking about it or not. Our conscious thoughts are only about 20% of what we are actively thinking; The rest is static in the background.   


So, say you have not had COVID yet: ""Oh, I won't get it"", or ""If I get it I'll be fine!"" is what is being thought and that's the future for you. Then once you get COVID, you change that thinking to ""Wow, I am actually sick. Look at these people dying. What if this has a negative effect on me in the future?"". This process is what leads to that ""PTSD"" you are mentioning, because now that its been experienced, you realize it can happen again (maybe, TBD). Add in all of the news, talk in general conversation, and lifestyle changes consumed by COVID, you cannot escape that trauma. Therefore, your body begins to develop physical symptoms I listed above. It has been proven that prolonged periods of high stress can lower the immune system, thus causing one to be more susceptible to further illness (Option A). OR you start to ""overthink"" and suddenly you focus on symptoms and how you're feeling. This is known as a somatic stress response (often characterized in those suffering from ""Health Anxiety""), which allows you to physically feel whatever you make yourself believe you are feeling (Option B). 

&#x200B;

SO, there is no real answer as to why long-COVID is a thing from a MH perspective, but those individuals, such as the OP and others who are ""just not right"", may wish to look at it more as a traumatic / stress response, rather than a physical medical problem.",kt0qvf
"My mental health has gone way down too...I use to workout everyday, dieted, cared out school but now I couldn't care less about those things and I don't ever wanna leave my bed!",kt0qvf
That makes me so happy to hear!,kt0qvf
Grrrrreeeaaaattttt,kt0qvf
Amen to this!!,kt0qvf
Yes the a anxiety is part of it!  But it does pass.   B vitamins and melatonin will help.  You are young and you will recover!  Focus on your health and day by day you will feel better.,kt0qvf
"There is a reason I said words like ""think"" or ""probably"". I never did say I was correct but thats my opinion and right now I think it does more harm than good to our body so it's very possible it might shorten someones lifespan. And the person asked a question so I tried answering it but no one can really answer that because we don't know the answers to it. There have been many people who have had heart problems and other health problems from the virus and still have those problems after 9 months or even longer than that.",kt0qvf
My feet are always either 100% cold or 100% hot!,kt0qvf
I cant tell you how much I appreciate your comment! Thank you for the reassurance!,kt0qvf
ME TOO....my neck has been killing me! Nothing helps it hoping it gets better over time! Good Luck and hope we get better soon!,kt0qvf
Thank you and I will def check with my Doc.,kt0qvf
I will ask! Thank You!!,kt0qvf
"That is an absolutely awesome response. Thanks so much for your insight. Part of me would like to start or join a movement to advocate for COVID survivors and bring awareness to the mental, emotional, and physical tolls that COVID can have on people, and to advocate for more support. It kind of breaks my heart to see so many people on here who feel lost, alone, and afraid. There really seems to be a dearth of resources available for that.",kt0qvf
"Some of those could just be depression due to (gestures everywhere), but then again, i feel like my longest lasting symptom was my brain too.  It is difficult to decipher what is general malaise due to covid, or just it seems like lockdowns, and general politics (if in the US) gets you down.  Best luck out there.",kt0qvf
"Just jumping on, I had covid in November which lasted about a month. My anxiety and depression was at its peak.
I have been really breathless since but have recently restarted my anti anxiety meds. My breathlessness and tightness in my chest had improved, and obviously so has my mental health.
If you haven't already I recommend contacting your doctor whether it's for mental health or post covid health. 
Hope you start to feel better soon x",kt0qvf
"Although I‚Äôm still experiencing the cough and fatigue, I‚Äôm so glad that once I was allowed to end my isolation that I left the house and started walking. I started with just 15 minutes it was all I could do and now 6 days later I can manage 8 miles (if it‚Äôs a good day). Important to give yourself a routine, don‚Äôt lie down (especially for lungs and chest), stay busy and stay away from news and screens.",kt0qvf
"I got it in March and have been a long hauler ever since. I'm mostly better now but for a long time it felt like it was doing something to my neurochemistry. I had insomnia for months, brain zap rushes, and this weird anxiety that wasn't connected to any worry that got worse when my other symptoms got worse, it just felt like the physical symptoms of anxiety not connected to any stress. My typing and spelling made me look half illiterate. As I got better I felt like I was micro dosing MDMA immediately after exercise - intense unnatural waves of bliss that would last for an hour or two after going for a walk.",kt0qvf
there's not one person out there enduring long covid who buys that bullshit. the least we can all have is the dignity of our illness taken seriously.,kt0qvf
Having a novel disease can definitely be contributing to these feelings. The emotional roller coaster can be just as harmful as the physical symptoms.,kt0qvf
Thank you and Im glad you are on the mend! Im hoping to get in with my Doc soon!,kt0qvf
Thank you for this,kt0qvf
"Yes definitely do it, I think a lot of my breathlessness came from my anxiety. Just have a discussion with them as I know there's meds specifically for long covid? All the best!",kt0qvf
Thanks again!,kt0qvf
"I had the same experience! I‚Äôm 29 F with asthma and I‚Äôm overweight and my only real symptom was that I would sleep like 16 hours at a time. Got tested and it came back positive, and I was so scared it was going to get worse but I never got sick. Honestly the anxiety was the worst part!

Obviously I‚Äôm super lucky and I know this isn‚Äôt the case for everyone, but just letting you know it can totally stay mild! 

Hope you have a similar experience!!",ktm402
I've had worse colds and flus before . Covid was no big deal to me except all the mental anguish because of being a disease and morbidity rates.,ktm402
"I would say with your mild symptoms and if you really started on 1/1 then you‚Äôre most likely in the clear. I mean, you could develop respiratory symptoms between days 5 and 10 (assuming your first day was actually later than 1/1), but without even a cough I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs probably a low chance. And there‚Äôs a wide spectrum between ‚Äúno respiratory symptoms‚Äù and ‚Äúneeds a ventilator‚Äù, so even if you develop something it probably won‚Äôt be anything big. Just watch your oxygen levels (if you have an O2 sensor). But yes, most mild cases stay mild.",ktm402

We've gotten our flu shot every year because of that nasty episode, so when I learned I had covid, I had to try reeeeally hard not to psyche myself out. Which, admittedly, I did a few times lol.

"I started losing my sense of smell on day 1 and completely lost it by day 3.  I can still taste but the food tends to taste saltier and I lost the more nuanced taste (like spices).

Everyday, I tried to smell my perfume, scented candles, vicks, lemon, my soap etc.  On day 8, I caught a whiff of lemongrass of the scented candles for a few seconds.  Then it‚Äôs gone foe the rest of the day.  The next day, I started to smell the alcohol in my perfume but not the lavender/sweetness of the smell.   Then this too was gone at night.

This on and off smell is coming and going from day 8 - day 12.  On day 13, I smelled a whiff of burning stove and found that I forgot to turn off my stove (almost burned my house down there).  On day 14, I regain about 50%.  Funny things is that I can smell the good smell (like perfume, soap, shampoo) but I can‚Äôt smell my dog poops or my own farts.",ktwuz2

Unfortunately I won't have any personal advice but I can at least my two cents based off of what I had experienced with people close to me that have been positive.

For the most part it seemed like they were all sick for about 2-3 weeks, the ones that had symptoms that aligned with yours had pretty mild cases thankfully. I think one of them did end up getting an inhaler for their SOB but they a bit on the heavier side. Most just rested, isolated themselves and made sure to stay hydrated.

"9+ months later and my sense of smell seems to be permanently warped. Things I used to love like laundry detergent, face wash, or air freshener now smell rancid like food that has started to turn. 

Ironically normally stinky smells like rotten milk, garbage or feces has a very mild or non existent scent.

"It‚Äôs been 5 months. My taste and smell are still not back. I was next to something burning in the kitchen and I could not smell it. Everything tastes different like chemicals, or perfume or detergent. Sometimes I get a lingering chemical smell. Other times I get phantom smells.

I am pretty lucky so far-I‚Äôve really had no issues breathing, just really congested, sore throat, headache and fatigue.  
My sense of smell and taste are gone, and I‚Äôm having a really hard time with this.  I‚Äôm completely depressed, and can‚Äôt imagine life never being able to smell or taste again.  I‚Äôm devastated.  I have read that this comes back for some people, though not all.

"I'm about 40 days in. Can smell some things, but no taste. Holding out for that six-month mark! xD",ktaq3y
"I‚Äôm posting my experience in a lot of similar smell/taste threads just in case it helps someone else:

I only lost taste and smell for 2 days, but as soon as it happened I started eating and drinking *only* anti-inflammatory foods/beverages. I was dumping turmeric and black pepper in green tea with honey, eating cherry tomatoes, raspberries, saut√©ed beets, yellow & purple potatoes, pomegranate juice, the works. I even ate cloves of raw garlic.

I‚Äôm not some health food fanatic, and I can‚Äôt really say for certain whether this is what helped it come back so quickly, but my roommate who also caught covid didn‚Äôt eat quite so healthy, and his smell is still not back after 2 weeks post-recovery. My senses have gone back to normal (tested positive 12/29).

Obviously, this experience is purely anecdotal, but an anti-inflammatory diet may help.",ktaq3y
"Yep, almost exactly the same for me. It started to come back on day 9ish, but was really hit and miss depending on what I ate. After about 3 weeks though I'm back to normal.

Anyone who's hasn't come back yet, don't panic. From what I've read it can take up to a few months to completely repair the damage caused and very much depends on the individual in terms of healing time. The good news is it's pretty certain that in time it will repair for you :)",ktaq3y

Back when I was having really bad relapses during the first 3 months, I visited several specialists (cardio, pulm, covid specialist, psych) and was basically told it was all in my head. I stopped making appointments and just dealt with it at home. Everything else has lessened in severity but the smell has remained the same.

Olfactory training sounds like something I‚Äôll need to look into. I‚Äôm willing to give anything a shot if I‚Äôm able to. Hope to visit a neurologist or ENT soon and bring this up.",ktaq3y

I know realistically I have probably had the virus for longer than my symptoms started showing but I heard on other posts that you usually lose it near the end of your quarantine period",ktnsen
"It‚Äôs completely up to you whether you are gonna isolate for 10 or 14 days. I was just making sure you knew it‚Äôs actually 10. 14 is for those who were exposed but didn‚Äôt show symptoms. It‚Äôs because the longest incubation period is 14 days. So those are two different numbers with two different meanings. 

I am 21 and lost my sense of taste and smell in about 3 days, and my symptoms were mild and I am fine now. There‚Äôs no need to worry.",ktnsen
Thank you! You have definitely eased my anxiety. I appreciate you,ktnsen
How long did it take you to regain your sense of smell and taste? I just lost mine today after testing positive on Thursday and I‚Äôm going crazy! I legitimately cannot smell a thing! üò©,ktnsen
You'll be better soon. You're likely almost through this,ktnsen
It gradually improved until it became normal about 2 to 3 weeks after. But it can take longer or shorter than that. It was very annoying! I remember I was having a hard time drinking water.,ktnsen

about 5 days ago they were going to remove him from the ventilator but his tubes became clogged, with what I‚Äôm assuming was a mucus plug because my dad had/has pneumonia.

That makes sense. It‚Äôs likely the ET tube that is clogging with mucus. And it makes sense after an episode of that he‚Äôd need increased oxygen for a while. But good to hear they were able to bump it back down. I hope they are able to continue to wean his oxygen.,ktfd9i

Sadly it is not a good thing. It means he has a lot of thick mucus that is clogging his breathing tube which will limit how much oxygen he gets. Since he is intubated and sedated he can‚Äôt cough up those secretions they need to be suctioned out by staff.,ktfd9i

"The Reddit rumor mill has been saying that COVID may accelerate dementia (its a blood disease that impacts capillaries... see sense of smell, COVID toes & eyes, etc), and this sort of money focused confusion and irritability / anger is in line with symptoms of dementia.

As a non-expert citing no sources, my suspicion is that your mother may have been 5 years away from old-age dementia starting to come into play, and COVID moved that time frame up 15 years so now she's in the thick of it.

I'm sorry you and your mother are going through all this",ktkjf7
"When people isolate and don't have enough to do, they spend their time thinking.

I'm guessing some of this alone time probably has something like a ganzfeld effect for the mind. The ganzfeld effect is hallucinations triggered by sensory deprivation. People cut ping pong balls in half, or use a curved sheet of paper and place them over their eyes, while listening to white noise, and this induces the hallucinations after about 30 minutes.

When the mind doesn't have outside stimulation to work with, it creates its own.

The same thing probably applies here. Since we're all isolating we don't have any new personal developments in our lives, every conversation is the same over and over again, because every day has been the same for most of us. After a while, it gets easier for wild ideas to pop up, and harder for some to not run with them.",ktkjf7

My mom had not talked about harming herself or others, and I've asked my brother to keep an eye on that since that was an early concern (besides the extremely personal nature of her attacks at me). 

I'm going to share this article with my brother. At this point, I don't think she'd consent to be evaluated because she doesn't think anything is out of the ordinary.

My mom is a caretaker for my dad (they've been separated for decades), and he has Alzheimer's and dementia. So I am very familiar.

I saw the writing on the wall early and went nuts trying to figure out what I'd do if I had to go somewhere where I felt may have active Covid virus waiting to be breathed in or land on me.  It's of course the opposite of your situation, but applicable.

Ever see those clear disposable rain gear outfits that people in Asia wear in the rain?  Great to wear for a few minutes then dispose of.  Then there is clean room booties for shoes.  Yep, I bought them.  

Then there was the P100 respirators, KN 95 masks and some face shields for protection.  (I've saved the face shields for emergency use only - like if we get Covid infection in the household and having to care for someone)

Every time I use hand sanitizer, I use enough to clean the bottle too.  I clean all my groceries as well.

I quit putting cloth hand towels in the bathroom and installed a commercial paper towel dispenser.

I may be nuts. Then again I'm not young anymore and have had too many cases of bronchitis and pneumonia in my life.  My lungs are not as strong as the should be.  Serious Covid could be it for me.  I like living.

If Covid enters my home, it won't be my doing.  As for the rabbit hole, I'm quite comfortable in it. üê∞üê∞üê∞",ktmrwl

You're more likely to get it from someone breathing than on surfaces.  Just frequent hand wash and sanitize. I know you want to keep your mom safe but truly this is all you can do, and if you get covid you just have to learn to cops with said diagnosis. To get back to some normalcy try wiping down or spraying surfaces 1x daily with disinfectant. Then every other day wipe down, or spray. Until you get comfortable again.",ktmrwl

"I feel like my negative test three days ago might have been inaccurate. I had some all over head pressure Sunday night Jan 3rd. This continued Monday and I had the chills and felt feverish, but was unfortunately at work and the infrared thermometers were reading my temp at 97-98. I developed run of the mill aches and that body feeling of having a fever, got home and my mouth thermometer read 100.6. Scheduled a self swab at CVS the next day, which I did at 1230pm. No fever that day, but still achy and the head pressure was about a fourth to half of what it was. A slight sore throat kicked in that night and overnight one tonsil swelled up. By the time I woke up, the tonsil went back down, but partially swelled up over the day although nothing substantial. I've had off and on chest congestion that is also nothing to write home about. Got my results at like 430am Thursday by a texted link. Negative. Ok... I've felt better each day, but yesterday I felt off by 5pm and nauseous with a very very slight sore throat that by itself was of no concern. Today - Jan 8th. I feel off again, decent allergies acting up, but I don't know how or why because I haven't been anywhere since the test and I have cut out all foods that used to cause my allegies. I'm feeling digestion/stomach troubles again and all I've had to eat is some fruit and almond butter. I currently have a very lowgrade fever of 99.3, some serious sniffles and a little sneezing. I feel like I should retest because I'm due back to work on Monday for having it be negative and just waited the rest of this out working from home all week. I also have not had an appetite since last Saturday.

"I've started to gather that this isn't that uncommon of an occurrence. I just scheduled another self swab for tomorrow morning at CVS. I just wanna be sure about the results. This isnt the worst I've ever felt, it's minor overall, but the fact that the fever is coming back on day five after only being around on Monday, that's the most worrisome. Even with the negative result yesterday morning, I worked from home the whole week as to keep other germs out of the office. I hope you are both not feeling too bad and can recoup well.",kt6cde

I'm feeling better. I still have a lingering cough which is really annoying and worse for getting out because you know what happens when someone coughs in public.  So I'm just laying low and waiting to see this cough through.

How are you?",ktidp8
"I'm glad you're feeling better! Funny enough, I didn't get the cough at all. My boyfriend, who also tested positive, has the cough though.

Yes! Even prior to getting sick and testing positive I felt self conscious just clearing my throat at the grocery store.

I'm okay, still a little fatigued, grateful to be over this mostly. I just need to keep an eye on my asthma. Emotionally exhausted which stinks.",ktidp8
"I read that it's important that post-covid patients should all get x-rays to see if there is any damage to lungs. I am going to request one. Maybe you should too just because of the asthma.  It's better to know than to fall short down the line.

"You're one of a handful of people who I've heard say had vivid, unusual dreams with Covid. This was one of the most anxiety-inducing of symptoms for me. I didn't just have vivid dreams... I had traumatic, hyper-realistic nightmares. Things I've never seen in my life. 

I mean, you'd think fans of horror could expect to have nightmares about the movies they watch, right? Or that little kids who saw only black and white cartoons might have dreams without color. You expect ""what goes in comes out."" So when I say I had nightmares about things I've never seen before, I mean I have no idea how my brain could even conjure up such images of horror. It was terrifying. I was afraid to sleep. I had frequent, paralyzing flashbacks for days. 

Were your vivid dreams positive each time?",kt9h46
That was one of the toughest parts of the whole experience. My anxiety really spiraled out of control at some points.,kt9h46
"It was so strange. I would try to fall asleep, but as soon as I closed my eyes, my brain started to conjure up vivid, weird thoughts, not necessarily scary, but very weird. Like I would hear strange, inhuman sounds and noises I never heard before and saw things I had never seen. Like you said, I don't even understand how my brain put these ideas together. Then I would suddenly wake up. I don't even know if I actually fell asleep at all. It felt like I kept almost falling asleep then suddenly waking up for the entire night. I really only experienced this for that one night. Then I started taking melatonin which helped a lot. It was especially strange for me because I'm one of those people who hardly ever remembers my dreams.",kt9h46
This is wild - have you ever read The Stand?,kt9h46
"I should document my Covid19 experience as I came across this while searching for posts about drinking alcohol after it. 

I typically have nightmares most of the time and have had sleep paralysis a few times so I'm pretty used to this. I have taught myself to get over this since I was a young kid as far back as I can remember. However when I was ""sick"" (I had weird not common symptoms, positive on 12/18 still not 100% back to normal.)
 I started having these weird nightmares starting around about a week before I tested positive. These weren't regular nightmares they felt more real then normal. This may sound crazy but some nights the nightmares would continue from the previous night. It was like you're live in a horror film and were paused when awake and as soon as you're asleep again it played.  These nightmares were all so real that some nights I would be afraid to sleep. It's  slowly going away now and back to normal or maybe I'm just dealing with it better. 
I thought this was happening because I had a lot of anxiety over testing positive but now I'm thinking it may be related to Covid",kt9h46
I don‚Äôt even consider myself to be high anxiety. I have bouts of it and definitely know what it feels like but this whole thing has made me really sympathize with people with chronic anxiety/ depression.,kt9h46
"Yeah, I hardly remember my dreams, either! Like normally I'll wake up and think ""that seemed like a cool dream"", and try to recall detail; but I can't. So these were extra bad for me. Every grisly detail stuck with me throughout the day. I couldn't even bring myself to tell my boyfriend what I saw because it was so traumatic and I worried that putting it into words would further cement it into my memory.",kt9h46
I have not. What is that,kt9h46
"I've never heard of it, no. Now that I see your description of it I simply HAVE to read it. That's insane",kt9h46
"That doesn't sound crazy at all. Because it's exactly what happened to me- the nightmare froze when I woke up and continued later when I slept again. It wasn't always the next day; the nightmare could somehow be ""on hold"" for multiple days. I'd start feeling safe to sleep again, have consecutive nights without the terror, and then BAM. Right back in the nightmare a week later. 

And same! I've never had dreams that felt as real as these did. I was smelling things, feeling objects that I was touching in the dream, sweating (I rarely sweat), shaking in fear, and seeing a 360¬∞ view of my location. It sounds weird, but usually when I dream if I turn around the dream morphs into something else entirely. 

Also, I'm used to lucid dreaming- having quite a lot of control over where I'm going and what I'm doing in dreams. In these nightmares I'd try to control what was happening but I couldn't.

I've had sleep paralysis since I was a kid, too! Mine was frequent enough that I also learned to have some control over it. Luckily I haven't had a sleep paralysis episode for about 6 years straight. 

Are you saying you were consuming alcohol when these nightmares would happen? I didn't drink at all. 

In case you want to check it out, a few people in the Facebook Covid Survivor Corps group have mentioned having unique nightmares like us.",kt9h46
"It's a Stephen King book about a man-made virus that kills 99% of the population. Without spoiling anything, the survivors realize they are all having the same vivid dreams telling them to do stuff.

It's long but a real classic!,kt9h46
"I'll have to check that group out because we are having the exact same thing going on right now!! 

I actually become wicked nauseous when I drink alcohol now after having covid so I quit drinking. 

These dreams are happening every time I close my eyes no matter if its for 20 min and hour or a full night sleep. These dreams are different I can't control then or change them like I could. Its like I'm stuck in a real life nightmare every time I sleep or rest.",kt9h46

At this point she likely wouldn‚Äôt even be admitted to the hospital with those symptoms, nevermind getting a treatment like that. 

She needs to stay in contact with her pcp. If she is as high risk as you say, she should have a strong relationship with her pcp and follow their guidance.

It's always been recommended to stay away even if you both have/had covid. if she can manage with the isolation that is likely best. If she can't then you should still try and wear a mask and wash hands etc.,ktf275

In the same boat. I had it first. A few days after I recovered she showed symptoms. We are worried about it ping ponging back and forth. Any validity or science behind this happening or not? I thought I‚Äôd have antibodies that would protect me from reinfecting myself (surfaces I‚Äôve infected / bed etc) so it should protect me from her giving it to me as well (assuming it‚Äôs the same strain which we are almost positive about),ktf275
Are there any studies out there that give support to this idea? I have heard about it but just haven't been able to find much info on it. I'm just worried about any possibility of prolonging either of our timeline with this virus,ktf275
"Ill try to explain it as simple as I can. Your¬†viral load is simply how much¬†virus¬†you have in your body. If you are already infected with the said covid and other viruses like flu, rhinovirus, you wont keep swapping more viruses to one another because you are already infected, and have your own viral load.  Its that initial exposure to someone elses viral load they are hypothesizing that makes someone more sick or have a mild case. On r/covid19 or r/coronavirus they have had many studies and articles on it.",ktf275

"You can get a reinfection, antibodies are lasting differently for everybody. They are saying 3-8 months.

"When did you test positive? 

Full caveat, I have tested negative, but I've had similar symptoms but a different progression, i.e. I have consistently had covid brain for 7 days, it was an early symptom.",kt9d5w

"I received my positive result today, but I was exposed on December 8th. Either I had an abnormally long incubation period, or the overwhelming lack of motivation I experienced most of winter break was actually from COVID.",kt9d5w
"Hospital induced delirium is a medically known term. The stress on a person being ill, isolated, medicated and likely over stimulated/ disrupted sleep has very real biological effects. It‚Äôs terrifying when you know that the behavior is not normal for your loved one. My mother had multiple admissions this year for extended amounts of time and it was almost unbearable to what her seemingly go nuts. She was combative and convinced people were poisoning her and many other things. 
Know that the staff know these behaviors are not normal and definitely do their best to keep them safe and calm. I pray that your Dad can recover.",ktg2bs
"I‚Äôm dealing with this now with my mom, age 70. She is in the hospital and is convinced that they are trying to kill her. She keeps texting and calling me telling me I have to get her out of there. It‚Äôs very scary. Doctor says she‚Äôs hypoxic from all the oxygen they‚Äôre giving her",ktg2bs

"Yes the nurses have been amazing, they are calling and updating. They had to restrain him because he‚Äôs getting combative. But if he doesn‚Äôt get better they are going to lower his oxygen and put him on morphine. It‚Äôs a nightmare. Thank you for replying, I appreciate the information",ktg2bs
That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening to him. It‚Äôs terrifying. They had to put mittons on him because he keeps ripping his tubes out. I‚Äôm so sorry your going through this too. It‚Äôs awful,ktg2bs
Have you arranged power of attorney or are there advanced directives made? It‚Äôs very difficult when someone is altered but possibly still legally deemed competent.,ktg2bs
"You need to understand what they are suggesting there and have a much clearer conversation. If they are looking to withdraw treatment, and place him in a morphine drip, you need to understand they are attempting to start end of life care. There needs to be 100% clarity between what you expect and what they‚Äôre expecting, because I don‚Äôt think those things are aligning right now",ktg2bs
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this too. It‚Äôs nice to know we‚Äôre not alone. Comfort in numbers. Hope they both recover üôè,ktg2bs
"No I don‚Äôt think we do, my brother and my stepmother live in the same state with my dad, and I‚Äôm out of state. My brother has been the contact person so far, but I don‚Äôt think he has power of attorney.",ktg2bs
Yes I understand that. Which is why I said we are not ready for that.,ktg2bs
"Pretty much exact same symptoms I had in June (31/m).  Had low grade fever for 2 to 3 days highest was right over 101.

After day 4 is when I lost sense of smell.  Had a little bit of congestion come on around the end of the first week.  Then smell came back around day 10 and congestion went away shortly after.  Hoping you stay mild as well :)",ktit6w
