"No. The post-war, post-energy boom is over. America led the world in productivity, but now China, India, and other countries are experiencing the growth we did. 

Think of this as the great averaging. America is being averaged with the rest of the world. Their standard of living is increasing, while ours is going down.",kvn9w6

https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/11/how-income-varies-among-u-s-religious-groups/

44% of Jews are in the 1% income bracket, and 36% of Hindus


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income


Whites in the USA have a median average income of 65,000 per year

Indian Americans have a median average income of 123,000

Chinese Americans 81,000


Whites as a whole, are around the 17th wealthiest ethnic group in the USA counting Jews. If you seperate Jews from White people Jews go to number one, whites fall to #19, nice try though",kvn9w6

I just told my mom about those statistics (whether they are true/verified or not) and she started talking about democrat/""socialist"" policies that should be supported when I brought them up as solutions. She is a Trump conservative republican who constantly acts like a ""temporarily embarrassed millionaire"" and expects to come into riches at the age of 60, and she immediately started acting as if something needs to be done after years of apathy. Racism is *powerful*. This is why fascists get and maintain power so easily. 

Start telling that info to white conservatives and income inequality will instantly become the number 1 issue to them after years of ""pick yourself up by the bootstraps.""",kvn9w6
"It says nothing about them being in the 1 percent.

It just says that they make a family income over 100k.

Way different from the 1 percent.",kvn9w6
"Yes, they should know these facts


I'm a Republican, and I support State medicine, UBI, a generous welfare system, and a lower retirement age.




And the only people in the US talking about putting people in camps and ""cleansing america"", is the progressive left. https://youtu.be/t1r2rdmWsPE



I left the USA some years ago because of how aweful shit is there, and I live in a communist country, Belarus. The vast majority of Russian Marxists are to the right of American republicans;in the USA a progressive leftist would call a Soviet Marxist a fascist, so Id say the US as a country has no real idea of what an actual fascist looks like",kvn9w6
"They have almost twice the average annual income of the WASP segment of the population, maybe read the entire study instead of the tagline. 


You think 44% being over 100k means it stops at that point or something ? There's no jewish billionaires ?


36% of Hindus, likewise make over 100k


That's a lower percentage then Jews


However, the average annual income of a hindu family is 123,000.


What that means, is the huge number of billionaires and millionaires, raises the average so high. It works the same with Jews.


Jews are, the wealthiest ethni. Group in America, it is a fact, followed by Indian-americans and chinese Americans


White Protestants, are near the bottom in income",kvn9w6
"If anyone's wondering, yea this dude's post history is exactly what you'd expect lol

It‚Äôs almost like immigration is hard. And only the most successful make it here.,kvn9w6

"Or that the oft maligned ""white privilege"" and ""bias in hiring"", is either not real or it is, but everyone does it, and certain groups, help their in group at the expense of everyone else allowing certain groups like Jews or hindus to accumulate huge amounts of wealth and power by excluding everyone, which of course would be discrimination.


But if your saying that hard work determines success, then I guess we can eliminate affirmative action and every other ""equity"" based program",kvn9w6
Still have not received the $600. What a joke.,kwda8e
