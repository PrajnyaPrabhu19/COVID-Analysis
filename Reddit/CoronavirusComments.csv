"I am in Austria, and our vaccination program might be chaotic, but it is taking up speed. At the end of January, the 80+ generation will be vaccinated.

Yet, we are prolonging our lockdown and there is absolutely no sign of restrictions ending, despite our numbers are improving and we are vaccinating thousands of people per day.

I have lost quite a bit of hope. How is this Dystopia ever supposed to end?  Are we truly in a new normal?",kwc138
"If the Pfizer announcement gave us  the light at the end of the tunnel, the J&J data (if it's good) will give us a ferrari to get that light",kwc138
"I am an official contact tracer and on our weekly call they just told us that vaccine status means nothing.  Fully vaccinated people still have to quarantine if identified as a contact, they still need to isolate if they develop cold-like symptoms etc. etc.  I am feeling a lot of personal discouragement because of that, if the vaccine doesn't change anything will this ever end?!",kwc138
"I'm following the UK because that's where I live. Since daily numbers started to be released, we have been increasing our daily vaccination output by about 20k per day each day for the last 10.

Currently we're at between 150k and 190k vaccinations per day depending on which site you go to. At this rate with a 20k increase per day, we'll be at just over 1m vaccinations per day by 19 Feb. At that point nearly 1/2 of all adults in the UK will have had at least their first jab.

If we kept growing at +20k per day for the next 2.5 months, every adult in the UK would receive their first jab by 15 March and every adult would be fully vaccinated by 15 April.",kwc138
CDC Update: Almost exactly 951k vaccinations. Probably almost or over 1m considering the CDC only tracks first doses,kwc138
"so my grandparents are getting the first dose today. What does this mean for me, someone who has not seen them since like March? Once they get the second dose and the appropriate amount of time has passed will I be able to see them without fear ?",kwc138
"What‚Äôs going on with /r/covidvaccinated? I just got banned for misinformation for posting this comment...it was in response to someone saying that lots of people have died to the vaccine (a comment that had +6 votes)

>	Show me one proven report that lots of people have died from the vaccine. Also, with the sheer number of people vaccinated right now there‚Äôs bound to be stories of people dying shortly after receiving the vaccine, that doesn‚Äôt mean the vaccine caused it

"Is there any way to see how quickly vaccines are becoming available?   


It seems like good news that the vaccines are being made available rather than being held back, but I do wonder if this might mean that we could quickly use up the available vaccines and end up constrained by production.   


Of course, this isn't much of a problem if production is going well and ramping up. So is there any way I can see the rate of vaccine production/distribution?",kwc138
"It looks like this wave is starting to fizzle out? Cases falling and hospitalization on plateau. But deaths will keep rising, but new cases are going down. We are nearing the beginning of the end.",kwc138
"I have a question about vaccine supply (US): is the supply of moderna and pfizer that we currently have all that we will have for the next few months? JnJ also will only be a limited supply next month,  I think I read 10 million from them. Is that all we have until the spring/summer?",kwc138
local hospital changed their vaccines to 18+ since they weren't hitting their and goal and I'm nowscheduled for the pfizer tomorrow üò≠ I'm so happy,kwc138
"Anyway I want to hear about your predictions regarding J&J's data next week.

How soon can I expect any sort of protection?  How long after my 2nd shot can I consider ""going maskless""?",kwc138
"Can‚Äôt get over how pessimistic the general public has become about 2021. I was just reading a thread about a NYC music festival scheduled for late September and somebody sad ‚Äúsadly this will probably not happen, this pandemic is still a long ways off from ending‚Äù and everyone was agreeing with them for the most part. Like....what? It‚Äôs going to be mostly over by late spring!

COVID pessimism is endemic now, it‚Äôs not just isolated to certain posters on here and the doomer subs.",kwc138
"I know this was expected, but it's good news that the vaccine also prevents spread (according to the studies from Israel)",kwc138
"Hi: I have a question about Israel and the vaccine. 

&#x200B;

Israel has already basically vaccinated a majority of its vulnerable. Doesn't that mean that in the coming 2 or 3 weeks, we should start to see a dramatic drop off in deaths, with a less dramatic drop off in infections?",kwc138
"I see some people here saying they haven't seen their parents for over half a year or even longer. Why haven't you met in the open air, with masks and some distancing? A lot of elderly people have to go grocery shopping every week and this is a bigger hazard than meeting in a park with their children. I understand if the parent(s) are in care homes. Or is it a long lockdown or what is the reason?

Edit: thank you, I understand now. I live in a small country, I didn't think of the vast distances people need to travel, quarantine for 14 days, different health risks, etc. Understandable.",kwc138

"Spain is really speeding their vaccination up! +100,000 vaccinated in a day. First entire week was 86,000 vaccinations. We have already increased our vaccination speed ninefold. We still need to increase it at least threefold if we want a normal summer though",kwc138

"Want to know what I'm furious about?

My wife's aunt lives in a gated community in Florida. Same one as Paul Manafort's house arrest. Lots of filthy rich people. The wealth there is absolutely disgusting.

They've all already gotten their vaccines. My wife's aunt is in her early 60s, no risk factors, and has already gotten her first shot. So have plenty of healthy younger folks who are not healthcare workers, nor are they at risk, just rich. All getting vaccinated. Meanwhile, I know folks pushing their 80s with high risk factors who have gotten nothing.",kwc138

Will COVID19 be weakened as a virus in general due to vaccines in a year? Was it like this when the flu broke out?,kwc138
Is there a website where you can view the amount of vaccines given to people on a daily basis?  I searched online and have seen Bloomberg's summary but they only show the total amounts.  Is there a graph or website that shows the amounts that have been given out per day?  Thank you!,kwc138

I am deathly allergic to Penicillin. Should I consider this vaccine? I'm not anti vax at all whatsoever. I get the flu shot every year as well.,kwc138
Over the last week Arizona is #1 in both cases and deaths per capita.,kwc138
"This may be an ignorant question, but now that vaccination started, how long will it take to daily cases/deaths to be at pre-march 2020 levels?",kwc138
"I‚Äôm scheduled to take the moderna vaccine in a couple hours. I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with vaccine news, so with this vaccine I would not experience symptoms such as lost as smell taste and all the other bad things, but I can still contract the virus and give it to ppl I live with? I probably wouldn‚Äôt even know I was positive then right since I would most likely be asymptomatic",kwc138
So J&J is fucking up and having production issues already? That's disappointing.,kwc138
"Question: Is the vaccine made with eggs or incubated in eggs like the flu vaccine? I'm allergic to eggs and can't get the flu vaccine without an allergic reaction (Swelling of injection and slight fever). Last time I got the flu vaccine, the swelling was about the size of a lemon. I really want to get the vaccine but I'm concerned about an allergic reaction. If eggs aren't involved, I'm good to go.",kwc138

"Hey  all! I need help answering this questions about the Covid Vaccine. A  friend of mine keeps bringing them up, but we dont have the molecular biology background  to answer them, so please help if you can - or guide us to some  appropriate reading material !  


 Here we go:

1. Is   there research done, or some confirmation, that the remains of the  mRNA  vaccine will not become small interfering RNA - siRNA?
2. Is there research, or some confirmation, that the mRNA of the vaccine will not interfere with the mitochondrial DNA?
3. Could the mRNA from the vaccine interfere with the reverse transcriptase of some of the virus that are symbiotic to us?
4. Can we assume, or do we have evidence to suggest that the mRNA vaccines are safer than the vaccines with live weakened viruses?",kwc138
"Not sure if there‚Äôs a thread for people to post their vaccine story. 

I signed up for my first dose in two weeks!

My GF (nurse) got her second dose yesterday and felt tired, then woke up with a fever and body aches at 2am. This morning she still feels really sore and is sleeping again. Sounds pretty typical from what her nurse friends are saying. Still was surprised.",kwc138
"Can someone please explain this to me, my sister and her husband who work overseas were tested (nasal swab) on Thursday Jan 07, Friday Jan 8 (they travelled between two countries), Saturday Jan 09 all of which came negative. And then they showed up positive on a Tuesday Jan 12 (maybe that test was conducted on Jan 11 and the results arrived on Jan 12). 

I understand the virus load take times to develop etc. so when it is likely they were exposed? We want to see approximately how many days into the window of infection they are in. 

Thank you",kwc138
"I don't know about the world, but I'm not sure I'll ever be normal again. When I was forced to go back to work, I installed a clothes rack in my garage so I could dress and undress there, then go direct to the shower, to make sure I wasn't bringing anything home.  Started this before that much was known. Today I feel like the risk of that is low as long as I don't go rubbing my clothes in other people's faces after I come home.

&#x200B;

But that garage... it was okay at first, ya know, during the spring and then summer and then even the fall. But going out there naked at 7am with outside temp of 15 degrees F. There's no space heater that doesn't use something like propane that can help that.  Just too expensive to try to let heat out into it from the house too. So I froze for most of November and all of December before deciding I had had enough.

&#x200B;

It's now Jan 13th. And I still march toward that garage without clothes, always forgetting.  And I'm someone who changes his habits all the time, just to stay flexible. But this one doesn't want to shake loose. I kind of hate it. I don't want my life ruled by, my mind dominated, by this fucking pandemic any longer. And it occurred to me today that maybe I am permanently changed by this, and not in a good way.  It's not just this.  Just as the pandemic flared up I had all sorts of unrelated medical issues, I still face them today. This last year has just broken me. In my 40s, I have to wonder if this is just where it all breaks down.",kwc138
"I have a question regarding immunity.

My fianc√© has tested positive after having symptoms the last 10 days. I figured I would have got it from her, but turns out, I‚Äôve tested negative both times she has tested positive.  I figured the first test was a false negative, but the second test disproves that theory. 

Why would she test positive but I test negative, considering I haven‚Äôt been quarantined from her or anything? Is it possible that I was previously infected and just didn‚Äôt know it?  Is there a genetic aspect to who gets infected and who doesn‚Äôt? I haven‚Äôt been super cautious but I also wear a mask and social distance when possible. 

Sorry for the ranting questions, I‚Äôm just curious considering it‚Äôs just a weird scenario to be in.",kwc138
"Should I get antigen testing after getting my second vaccine dose? I know it's not recommended, but I just want to be sure. Do these antibody tests test for the same antibodies that the vaccine produces?",kwc138
"Not sure if this is the best place to ask. But, does anyone know if certain medications contaminate COVID spit tests? My wife has COVID, and I have the same symptoms as her. But, I have tested negative twice. Would I be better off getting a swab test?",kwc138
I'm sure Slaoui has inside data on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and that's why he said 80-85% efficacy. They unblinded their data for analysis and I'm sure top officials know that it works if not there wouldn't be all this talk,kwc138
Seems like the Asian countries that did so well protecting themselves against covid are all doing terribly at procuring and distributing vaccines. Foolish complacency.,kwc138
"There are zero signs in the data, if you look at Worldometers, John Hopkins, etc, zero signs that any of this is slowing down yet.  That is SO frustrating.  I know we just started vaccinating under a month ago, but between the 9 million doses and all the natural infections, plus masks and distancing its still not making even a tiny dent in this winter surge.

What‚Äôs going on here?  Am I just being overly impatient?  When can we expect numbers to start going down?",kwc138
"4,400 deaths. And it's only for a Tuesday. Will we see 5,000 this week?",kwc138

Anyone else seeing a trend of places just moving events to towns with laxer restrictions?  It's pissing me off.  There was a big New Year's 5k (with a party afterwards) that my town refused to give a permit to so they just moved it to a town 30 mins away that would and went on as usual.  Just saw a story today that local theatre group is returning to live theatre in the spring.  The city refused to let them have the space they typically have due to covid so they're moving all of their productions about 30 mins away to a neighboring town and proceeding as usual.  It's starting to piss me off and it's a major problem with the patchwork restrictions.  My town has restrictions and you can argue whether they're reasonable or not but it doesn't matter when you can drive 20-30 mins away and do whatever the fuck you want.  Then those people send their sick to our hospitals because we're a bigger town and better equipped.  So the county that is doing things better ends up suffering because the one next door is mask free and no restrictions.,kwc138
"If we let it run rampant and don't do anything about it, our healthcare system would collapse and the death rate would sky rocket beyond the 2-3%. Car crashes, heart attack victims, people with the flu, someone who stubbed their toe and got an infection.. none of these people would be treated and in the US alone that would mean somewhere in the realm of 5-9 million people could die of Covid alone (2-3% death rate, minus the population who have confirmed gotten it), and possibly hundreds of thousands or millions more who wouldn't get treated for other common ways of dying. The elderly would be wiped out, basically. After that, THEN more economic hurt - panic, looting, more people hungry..

Sounds worse than our mental health during some lockdowns. Our politicians are just stingy and we live in a country that prioritizes capitalism over life.",kwc138
Is the White House still in control of counting and logging cases and deaths or was that returned back to the CDC?,kwc138
"I got my Moderna shot on Monday. 

How long should I wait before drinking alcohol? It‚Äôs been a long week already and I just want a glass of wine. 

Also has anyone received their second Moderna dose yet? I‚Äôm curious of what to expect since my initial side effects weren‚Äôt too terrible.",kwc138

How can we be sure that there will be no consequences to the vaccine in the long-term if testing was only last year?,kwc138
"After the most at risk of hospitalisation are vaccinated (I guess aged 70+) this will relieve pressure on the healthcare system and the numbers of deaths will drop significantly. This is when things will start to open up, but transmission rates could still be high.

Governments will probably accept more people getting sick, but not dying, as a consequence of getting the economy moving again.",kwc138
"Of course it will end. More a matter of ""when"" not ""if"".",kwc138
"That is fucked up.  That is the type of shit that makes you question if there is a hidden agenda.

If the ""vulnernable"" population is vaccinated and there is very little to no threat of people dying from the virus if they contract it ...than society should be open as normal. 

Small business is going to be extinct at the end of these lock downs. 

Let people live !",kwc138
Not sure how severe your lockdown is. But here in the states we aren‚Äôt even talking about decreasing restrictions until wayyy more people are vaccinated. I know a few states have even gotten MORE strict recently.,kwc138
"This is not the new normal.  The people who are most likely to die are not the group of people who spread this.  The most elderly or ill are stuck in place isolating, they are at the end of infection chains.  It‚Äôs the younger people in face to face jobs, or who socialise, who spread it.  Once enough of these people are vaccinated to get herd immunity to kick in (no community spread in your nation), then life is going to go back very much to pre-covid times.

I predict you will need a covid vaccine certificate in your passport the way you need one for Yellow Fever if you travel to the tropics.  You might even need this certificate to attend large events at home.",kwc138
"Maybe, but their production setback will keep that Ferrari under the speed limit.",kwc138
What‚Äôs the j&j announcement?  Is it sterilising?,kwc138
"Not really.

A better way to look at it is more vaccines = more cars in general. If that makes any sense. It's 4AM.",kwc138
Fuck that. Once I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôm not doing this shit any longer.,kwc138
"I mean I see the need to be cautious but I think a lot of people are just going overboard. People take vaccines for polio, mumps, etc. and then happily go about their business. It is the whole point of a vaccine.  I can see waiting a while for full efficacy or something but to pretend you didn't actually take the vaccine is too much.",kwc138
Some states guidance contradicts this. I know NH says if you're fully vacinated and have a contact you do not need to quarantine unless you develop symptoms,kwc138
Is this policy going to change any time soon?,kwc138
"There will be more supportive data in the coming months. When we know for sure the vaccinated are not getting severely ill, hospitals aren‚Äôt on the verge of collapse, and transmission by vaccinated people is proven to be low, that‚Äôs when we‚Äôll drop restrictions IMO.",kwc138
"I'm confident that the CDC will release official guidance revising this soon enough. The official CDC guidance already has exceptions for people who have already had COVID. It follows naturally that they'll add exceptions for vaccinated individuals.

"The point of the vaccine is to drive down deaths and hospitalizations to the point that we're no longer in a pandemic. Until then, we proceed like we've been doing for the last year.",kwc138
That‚Äôs awesome! I hope that happens!,kwc138
What I am focused on is the vaccination of the elderly. That is where almost all of the hospitalizations and fatalities are. I don't think we need to get to 50% vaccination to make a big difference. More like 15%.,kwc138
"Good luck for a great outcome.  There might be a ceiling to growth in there, but I hope not, and hope y‚Äôall get vaccinated this fast.",kwc138
"And they fixed the date,  so proud of them. Maybe tomorrow they can make it so 48 out of 51 states plus DC aren't the exact same color on thier map.",kwc138
"I absolutely would see my grandparents 2 weeks after thier second dose and the only precautions I would take would be anything they asked for to feel more comfortable and not going if I felt sick.  

The vaccine significantly reduces thier risk not only of catching it but having a negative outcome if they somehow catch it. Eventually we are going to have to live our lives.",kwc138
"The vaccines pretty much all have 100% effectiveness against severe Covid, so even if you infect your grandparents, which is incredibly unlikely, they won‚Äôt die.",kwc138
"Life is full of risk. It's up to you to decide what is or isn't risky enough. If you're grandparent's are fully vaccinated, there would be little risk to visiting them according to all the data we have right now. But the vaccine is 95% effective, not 100%.",kwc138
"Every decision has risk/rewards. After they are both vaccinated the risk to them should fall significantly but it will not be zero. It's really up to you and them if a 90+% reduction in risk makes it now worth it to see them. I personally would be more willing to see them but maybe still take some basic precautions. 

For example, if i felt at all sick, still avoid seeing them. Semi distance, by that i mean don't feel like you can't get close but also try a little to stay a few more feet than you would beforehand.

But all of this is up to your and their risk tolerance. 

I personally am waiting until myself and all of my family is vaccinated before i go back to visiting like normal but i am lucky enough to be able to visit most of my family now in outdoor settings. If you have not seen them in several months and outdoors is not an option, i think it would be worth it to go and take a very small risk.",kwc138
"Why haven't you meet them in the open air, maintaining a reasonable distance, and with masks? Do your parents go outside on their own, grocery shipping?",kwc138
"Just remember. that it takes awhile for your body to generate a full immune response. 

Your grandparents won't really have any protection until 13-14 days after their first dose, and the same is true for the 2nd dose.",kwc138

In the USA? If you squint you can maybe see a plateau starting in cases but the 7 day average has increased everyday recently.,kwc138
"according to California's public health director, the data is showing that it's starting to plateau in NorCal, but SoCal is still going full-on Florida. Honestly, i blame ppl themselves. People under 40 are out & about like the pandemic is over. Even in indoor malls 15 to 25% of customers are no longer masking. So if your region isn't impacted by Covidiocy then you'll probably see case rates decelerating in the next 2 to 3 weeks.",kwc138
Pfizer and Moderna are each producing roughly 4-5 million doses per week for the US.,kwc138
"In the Warp Speed brief yesterday I believe Slaoui said that J&J is expected to do single digit millions in February for the US. Then, probably just hitting double digit millions in March. And then in April it will significantly go up. Seems to be in line with what's being reported today",kwc138

Do you mean you *are* scheduled?",kwc138
"I'll play. 65% efficacy in preventing symptomatic infections, 99%-100% at preventing hospitalization. I am an optimist but I don't see J&J as likely to be much more effective than Oxford, which is also a vector spike delivery vaccine.",kwc138
I'll go with 80 percent efficacy and no hospitalized or deaths. I am hopeful that adenovirus 26 was a better choice but of course totally could be wrong. Really anything over 60 and preventing serious illness and deaths would be good.,kwc138
"78% efficacy, 99-100% in severe cases.",kwc138
"I'll toss in a prediction: 84% efficacy, 100% reduction in severe cases. Why those numbers? No idea",kwc138
"1 week. 

1 week after second shot in any non public scenarios you would of worn one previously. In public you should follow the rules.",kwc138
"I read 2 weeks for 50% immunity with Moderna and 1 week for 50% immunity with Pfzier for the first dose. 

2 weeks for 94.1% immunity for Moderna and 1 week for 95% with Pfizer for the second dose. 

Which is interesting to me because Moderna is a higher dose.",kwc138
"I give it like 2 weeks for any immunity to develop after either of the vaccines. So two weeks after the second vaccine you should be pretty much good to go. But that being said you should probably continue wearing a mask in high risk environments although I would be comfortable seeing close friends and family especially if they have been vaccinated. 

That being said avoid alcohol after being vaccinated. Unverified research has showed it maybe significantly detrimental to the desired immune response. I figured stop drinking for a month will be the worst thing ever even if it's completely BS. 

If anyone has any actual information on that other than the anecdotal Russian reports feel free to chime in.",kwc138
"You can never consider going maskless, these things are only 95% effective",kwc138
"The general public?  Or Reddit?  Most people I know in the real world are mostly ready to get back to normal later this spring / early summer, including even the most cautious and doom-focused.

Reddit on the other hand has become one big doomfest centered around COVID. It's like the entire site has become r/collapse. The Reddit hivemind is prone to doom.  As other posters said, it's a coping mechanism.  Don't let it get to you.",kwc138
"Sort of unrelated but past spring I‚Äôm 100% sure this will become a personal risk thing, like imo this summer i feel comfortable with the idea that I should be able to bar hop and socialize",kwc138
"There's an etiological theory of generalized anxiety disorder similar to this, e.g. it's easier to maintain an anxious disappointed state and have it be consistent, then be hopeful and have it come back down into anxiety and disappointment again- in short, it's a defense against emotional shifts. Sort of to be expected during a pandemic. 

Fauci did mention that Fall is looking good for concerts and venues to be back in business, so Sept. seems reasonable. What's the fest?",kwc138
Reddit seems to be extremely negative about covid. In the travel subreddit someone asked about possibly traveling in july and everyone was saying absolutely no chance with tons of upvotes. I was heavily downvoted for suggesting it could maybe be possible to travel between certain countries with how vaccine administration is ramping up.,kwc138
"I've got a cruise booked for October and I think it'll probably go. But I might not go, because I want to see how things run for a few months before I go.

I'm not so much worried about the virus (assuming I've had the vaccine) as I am about the cruise being less enjoyable if there are masks, social distancing, quarantines, or missed ports still happening.",kwc138
Electric Zoo better be on! Get those vaccines into arms. If Fall outdoor events end up being cancelled I'll lose it. I can't live like a hermit for the entirety of 2021.,kwc138
"You can only get your hopes crushed over and over so many times before you give up and just expect nothing to happen again.

"The doomerism over the future of things like international travel, concerts, and sporting events, like, REALLY affects me. Even if I don't believe it deep down, everytime I see a comment about how international travel will never come back or whatever, my stomach drops.

I don't like it. I probably spend too much time on these subreddits, lol.",kwc138
"And people will push back at a second summer of no fun allowed/sit on butts/watch tv too.

Personally if Black Widow keeps the new date I'm going.",kwc138
"Things are really bad right now, it‚Äôs hard to see the forest for the trees. It‚Äôs difficult for me to see a light at the end of the tunnel too. I have to keep reminding myself that the vaccines have as much life changing power as Covid. It seems odd that such a small thing could have such an impact, but I would have thought that about Covid a year ago.",kwc138
"I think people see that vaccines are rolling out and they're checking numbers expecting things to automatically drop. That's not how it works. It's gonna take time. But yeah... I can't wait until spring. Even if this takes until summer/mid summer, at least once my older relatives are vaccinated I can breathe a sigh of relief.",kwc138
"I wouldn't expect large events like concerts, especially indoors, to go ahead in the summer because it could overlap too much with vaccinating the general public, and they have to plan these things months ahead.  Also having to check whether people are vaccinated or something would be a huge pain.  By fall I would think events could go ahead though, as the level of vaccination could be high enough that there wouldn't be so much uncertainty.",kwc138
Oooo I haven‚Äôt seen the studies. Could you link them?,kwc138
Oh good. I was hoping we'd know this soon and we can stop pretending like everyone is going to need a mask after they've been vaccinated.,kwc138
Hospitizalations will be the number to watch. It should drop first. People take on average about a month to die from coronavirus plus sometime to get recorded so deaths will be slower to drop.,kwc138
Yep I think so. It takes time to go from infection to hospitalization to fatality and the people that are currently sick won't be affected by the vaccine obviously. But starting about 5-10 days after the first dose of the vaccine a lot less people in the target population should stop getting sick which should lead to lower hospitalizations and deaths. Should probably take something like 3-4 weeks.,kwc138

"Because a lot of people don't live in the same general location as their parents? 

We saw my parents in July and October - prior to July, we hadn't seen them for almost seven months because we live eight hours apart. Both times, we both stayed quarantined for two weeks prior, and my parents did a road trip here, being careful to stay distanced during their few bathroom breaks. 

After the October visit, they left with all of us acknowledging that we're unlikely to see each other until we're vaccinated, so likely sometime in the late spring. Cases were really starting to spiral out of control at that point, so we decided it wasn't worth the risk. 

Same with my husband's dad and stepmom - we saw them in October (same kind of deal as my parents) for the first time in almost 11 months. Haven't seen my husband's mom since November 2019. 

If we all lived close-by, then we'd absolutely have done a lot of outdoor visits, but we (like a lot of people) don't have that luxury.",kwc138
"My in-laws live 4 hours away and we have been trying to figure out where to stay if we go there. Don't want to stay with them obviously, not comfortable with a hotel either.

So my wife drove up there, spent 4-5 hours, and drove back, all in the same day.",kwc138
"Someone has to go through an airport and get on a plane for me to see my parents. (I actually did see them this past summer, I flew for my grandmother‚Äôs small funeral and only stayed one night, hoping that if I got Covid on the trip I‚Äôd be leaving before I was infectious. Luckily I did not get Covid on the trip.)",kwc138
"My mom gets delivery. I saw her outside once. We live a long ways away from each other, so that combined with the risk means I just don't see her.",kwc138
"Well the reason for me is that both of my parents live a distance thats plane travel away. One is super high risk, over 70+, multiple lung conditions, so he would basically not ""accept"" a visit from me unless I quarantined for 2 weeks first which with work is not possible. The other again lives multiple plane rides away and its hard to visit outside when its like 10 degrees outside. So that's that on that for me.",kwc138
"The people who say this are likely doing what you suggest but, it's just not the same. I haven't physically hugged my father since March 2019. Not because he's high risk, but because I am. I've seen him out in the open air with masks and distancing, and we FaceTime every day. But it's not the same as going over to watch a movie, or going to a sports game together, or going to dinner together.",kwc138
"It's too cold to stay out for more than 10 minutes where they live, and I don't have a safe way of getting there (I used to take the train). It is also illegal or highly not recommended right now - I live in a hotspot, they live in a rural region that have not been hit yet.",kwc138
"I have a penicillin allergy. Everyone in my family is allergic and our reactions is that we break out in hives. It didn't ask on the papers if we're allergic to anything, only if we've ever had severe reactions after any vaccine, which I haven't.

When I sat down with the woman administering the vaccine, she asked again if I have had any severe allergic reaction to vaccines, I said no, and I asked her if it was okay that I have a penicillin allergy. She said it was fine, and here I am 2 days later! My Mom also got the vaccine with me, also allergic to penicillin, and no reaction either.

Of course take it with a grain of salt and ask your primary and also whoever is administering the vaccine to double check but they have an area you'll be observed in staffed with paramedics in case anything happens.",kwc138

"Of the ~390k deaths in the US, about 100 (0.02%) are in people age 0-14 and 600 (0.15%) in age 0-24.

0-19 years: 0.00003

20-49 years: 0.0002

50-69 years: 0.005

70+ years: 0.054

So the risk is 1800 times higher for 70+ as 0-19.

My take is that kids are generally at very little risk -- as little risk as unusual things like swimming pool accidents and brain eating bacteria. Nobody wants any kids to get hurt obviously but statistically speaking their risk is very small. Their role in the crisis is primarily as carriers.",kwc138
"The mortality rate difference between the oldest and youngest is colossal. Young people have an almost nonexistent risk of dying from covid.

"What you should be angry about is the fact that the vaccine distribution is going much slower than it could be. There are 10s of millions of doses just sitting in freezers which could be helping to end the pandemic. The reason why this is happening is that there is a bunch of bureaucracy slowing down the vaccine distribution. This bureaucracy is intended to prevent people who ""don't deserve to get the vaccine early"" from getting it.  

Personally, I would far rather have a small number of rich people get the vaccine a couple of months earlier than they would have otherwise, than to have doses sitting around doing nothing. In some places vaccines are even being thrown in the trash rather than being given to the ""undeserving"". Everyone will get their turn eventually, but everyone benefits from faster vaccine distribution (less spread, back to normal sooner).",kwc138
I'm more angry at how slow the rollout is going in California.,kwc138
"I assumed that rich people would have better access. I've not heard as many stories as I'd feared.

Maybe I'm more okay with it, though, as everyone in my family and close friends are able to work from home and not going out into work on a daily basis, so they're safer compared to others who don't have the vaccine.",kwc138

Many don't realize that the hospitalizations and fatalities are heavily concentrated in the 65+ with health conditions. They make up about 12-15% of the population. Once they are vaccinated, hospitalizations and fatalities will plummet. This is why they are being vaccinated first or second.

"1. The mRNA vaccine is way too large to become in any way like siRNA (which are 20-24 bp). They are also single-stranded so cannot processed into siRNA that requires a double strand or hairpin structure to be processed into siRNA. 
2. The mRNA cannot pass through the nucleus or mitochondria because the lipid nanoparticle that delivers the mRNA in the first place only pass the cell membrane before being endocytosed and degraded. The mRNA stays in the cytoplasm.
3. The mRNA vaccine does not contain any RNA sequence that can prime a reverse transcriptases reaction. Viral reverse transcriptases are very specific since viruses  did not want to pick up any random RNA sequence.
4. mRNA vaccines are safer than attenuated virus. There is fear with the attenuated virus that if it is not weakened enough (mainly due to manufacturing and QC issues) it could stay virulent or induce a strong immune response during its rounds of viral shedding. But since mRNA cannot become virulent again due to carrying one antigen gene (compared to the attenuated virus which carry all the genes) it is limited in function and expression of a modified spike immunogen.",kwc138

To give you some perspective. 250 - 400 thousand people die of wrong medical treatment each year.

Up until they get all vaccinated.

Lockdown is a very devastating measure that should be used with great caution. If we blow up the economy, if there is no economy left, there would be a lot of homelessness, suicides, bankruptcy, divorce, crime, drugs, the decline in healthcare (Europe), etc. Are you willing to be homeless? Just the first lockdown and first wave measures resulted in over 130 million starving people. Some of them might die of starvation. If the economy collapses it might result in 10 million new starvation deaths, ad this to already 9 million starvation deaths, which happen every year despite covid.

You overestimate covid deaths. Most people survive. Even the 70 years old have a relatively good chance of survival. Given that the hospitals are not overwhelmed and can treat the ones who need care.
A covid infection does not mean a death sentence for the elderly.

If there was no combined vaccine, the covid death rate in the US would be 693,000 to 1,115,000  people.
US population 330 million
Herd immunity 70%
330 million x 70% = 231 million infections
The infection facility rate is 0,3 - 0,5% is the US. Other European countries the mortality rate is 0,1 - 0,3%.

I definitely agree with that. We're planning on doing things in the Summer and Autumn. We're both in healthcare and We've been vaccinated already though.

There was also an anecdotal relationship between the HPV vaccine and ovarian failure. After further study it was determined that these vaccines are still safe but there were some outcomes.

And then there were times that a live virus was accidentally dispensed instead of a vaccine and people got sick from that.

I get what you're saying but we need to not pretend our desire and necessity of ""working sick"" is *ever* a good thing for our society.

Elect leaders, and support management teams that let you go home and get well (AKA paid leave), instead of getting your team sick or risking your health. Or, bare minimum allow you to work from home if your job allows it. If people weren't forced to work sick, our influenza rates (And COVID for that matter) would plummet.",kwc138
There isn't yet data about how vaccines prevent asymptomatic infection or transmission.  It's likely that they do given the lower transmission rates in asymptomatic individuals but until the data is gathered and we see cases and hospitalizations go down it's wise to proceed with caution.,kwc138
Isn‚Äôt it because they‚Äôre not sure if vaccinated people can still spread the virus?,kwc138
"I assume because the vaccine is not 100% effective.  Therefore, a contact who has been vaccinated still has a 5-10% chance of being susceptible to infection.

I could see this changing in the future but not surprised if they're being cautious for now.  Assuming the goal of contact tracing is to stop further spread.

Also /u/PhoenixReborn rightly points out that studies have not been testing for asymptomatic transmission so there is some question as to whether a vaccinated person might still spread.",kwc138

For the record, I have seen my parents multiple times over the past year as I am fortunate that they are only a 30 minute drive away.

Now covid comes along and suddenly everybody is monitoring 24-7 their mental sensations like clock-work. There is also the effect of nocebo, the opposite of a placebo bill.

USA has an estimated 30% already infected with the virus and developed an immunity. Soon the old folks are vaccinated. I think that normal immunity will reach 40-50% in the next months. Coupled with immunity from the vaccines. This should slow the spread and stop the deaths. In the middle of 2021 we a lot of have immunity an can feel safe.,kwc138
We'll have a high enough percentage of people not getting vaccinated so this thing is going nowhere regardless of the effectiveness of the vaccine.,kwc138

"So there is no proof that you can't spread the virus to other people and that you would just be asymptomatic. ..

That being said this is new and there has not been enough research.

 The way all other vaccines work however if you don't show symptoms it's because you didn't catch it, not because you caught it but are asymptomatic.

"Eventually, even after vaccination,  coronavirus will reach a lot of people. The vaccination doesn't make a magic bubble around a person, it should help the immune system overcome the virus more efficiently. But because the virus is so prevalent, a lot of vaccinated people still contract the virus.

There is a really small chance to infect somebody with those measures. Even family members living under the same roof don't always infect one another. So even if your mom got infected.

A relative of mine got an infection in his mouth. Went to hospital and caught covid. Recovered from covid just in time to catch mrsa. Died from that. He'll be down as a Covid despite it not being the reason he was in hospital or the reason he died.

I'd say going in to a supermarket about 95% of people wear masks. It's law to wear one but at the moment you wont be fined for not wearing one.",kwfsgr
"Much, much high population density. There are circa 67 million people living on an island smaller than Texas. The government haven‚Äôt got it right, that‚Äôs for sure, but measures are being taken to curve the spread and stop the virus. That‚Äôs a lot more that can be said for the total lack of leadership in the US and that isn‚Äôt up for debate.

Edit - lack of leadership and lack of any real nationwide initiatives put in place.",kwfsgr
Then why the fuck did you ask why you should care?,kwfsgr
If masks don't work then why shut shit down in the first place?,kwfsgr
"So.. you want to be able to just quit and get paid instead.

Question for you... If everyone in that position did the same (and had the government support to do so, like you want), where exactly is the money for the government support going to come from?

Oh print it out of thin air? Sure.. but honestly if everyone that is still working decided to stop for safety, it stops even being a financial problem because no matter how much money you print, what goods and services are going to be available to buy with it if nobody is working in person?",kwfsgr
But I thought it was a hoax?,kwfsgr
Maybe /unimaginative needs to be a thing.,kwfsgr
"I know you're obviously not in Quebec, but is it true they're in a deep lockdown?  Do you think that could happen where you are as well?",kwfsgr

"Are we still comparing population densities of countries when like 90% of the population in both live in cities?


numbers/results trump anything else",kwfsgr
"Have you ever heard of a rhetorical question? And I said ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù to care, meaning we‚Äôve cared and there has been little to no reward for caring. WHY SHOULD WE CONTINUE TO CARE WHEN IT CLEARLY ISNT WORKING? You can only pick up shit off the ground for so long before you finally realize you have to fix the person taking the shit on the ground in order for there to be no more shit.
Understand?",kwfsgr
Because...less places open less opportunity for it to spread.,kwfsgr
"How about looking at  where your money is going and start giving it to people who actually need it.

"I‚Äôm in Ontario. Yes, Quebec is currently under an 8pm to 5am curfew. My work has a weekly company-wide call on Mondays and that includes employees from Montreal. One of them explained to us what happened when the curfew started. He said about 30 minutes before, everyone started getting emergency alerts on their phone telling them of the curfew. Then about 15 minutes before, emergency messages cut into the tv signals. He then said that by a few minutes after 8pm he could hear police helicopters circling around the city. Apparently the police have been out in full force enforcing the curfew. People are getting stopped and fined if they don‚Äôt have a legitimate or essential reason for being out. I think things like walking your dog is OK but probably only for a short period, and maybe things like medical appointments, that sort of thing. I don‚Äôt know the full details though.

Ontario has issued a ‚Äústay at home‚Äù warning starting just after midnight tonight. Not as strict as Quebec‚Äôs and our useless provincial government has issued so many confusing mixed messages about what the ‚Äúrules‚Äù are that nobody really knows what‚Äôs going on. I think they are mandating that all office workers that can work from home must work from home and any non-essential businesses can only be open a shorter amount of time per day, have to close by 8pm, and must be doing curb side pickup. I don‚Äôt really know, it‚Äôs so confusing.",kwfsgr
"I am in Qu√©bec. There's a curfew from 8pm to 5am (except for essential workers, and that includes restaurant workers and delivery drivers), office workers have to work from home and construction/manufacturing is limited to essential stuff. Stores can do delivery and curbside pickups in the open hours, but have to make sure their staff can get home by 8pm.

All in all, it feels worse than this spring because it's the winter and going outside to chill isn't as fun/easy as it is in late April, but aside from the curfew which actively messes up with my circadian cycle (I'm used to going to the grocery store at 7:30pm for dinner supplies and eating at 8:30), it's not *that* bad. Nothing like it was in Italy, Spain or France last year at least",kwfsgr
"I know that the cure is not true, but POTUS actually said that doctors should be looking at that, the same as him being a genius, him understanding the virus better than anyone and his genius uncle from MIT",kwfsgr
"Well 90% of the US population don‚Äôt live in cities but regardless of that - if there are a majority of people living in cities in the US, they are geographically separated by hundreds of miles. In the UK, cities and urban areas spill over into each other‚Äôs city limits, ultimately indicating a faster spread among its population.",kwfsgr
"Nope, I truly don't know what makes you tick. Have a good day bud.",kwfsgr
"That didn't answer any of my questions.

I said IF the government paid people that can and do currently work to not work, how do you expect even the basics of the economy to function.",kwfsgr
">  I think things like walking your dog is OK but probably only for a short period

One idiot couple were stopped while out walking without a dog. One of them had a collar and leash and was acting the part of the dog, and that was their attempt to get around this narrow allowance.

Thankfully the cop didn't buy it and ticketed them both.",kwfsgr
Did they tell you how long this is going to last?,kwfsgr
Yes but he was wrong! Don't spread misinformation.,kwfsgr
"90% was just made up. In reality us is 82% urbanized and uk is 83% urbanized.

Everything else you wrote is just excuses",kwfsgr
"It's supposed to last until Feb. 8th, but that's open to change depending on the spread within the next month and the hospitalization figures I imagine.",kwfsgr
"You seriously need to get a grip and relax, nobody here, or at least I hope, nobody will go and start injecting disinfectant, I think everyone knows that what POTUS said was, as always, stupid and within his ignorance...so chill dude, your life will be better",kwfsgr
Sarcastically making fun of ludicrous statements made by the president is not the same as spreading misinformation.,kwfsgr
I don‚Äôt see how stating the fact that a virus will spread quicker in a small nation with a significantly higher population density than it would in the US where the population density is far lower is an excuse for anything. But you believe what you want to believe. Take care out there.,kwfsgr
